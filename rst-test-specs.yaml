RST-Test-Plan: 1.0
Version: 3.0
Last-Updated: 2023-09-27

Preamble: |
  The Test System consists of several *test plans*, each of which addresses a
  particular scenario. The test plans follow a standard structure and
  methodology derived from IEEE 829-2008 *(which has since been superseded by
  ISO/IEC 29119)*.

  Each *test plan* includes one or more *test suites* which in turn include
  one or more *test cases*. For a test to succeed, every test case has to pass.

  This file describes each test plan, suite and case in the RST system.

  ### 2.2. Note about DNS and DNSSEC test suites

  The DNS and DNSSEC test plans are taken from the test plans that are part of
  the [Zonemaster software](https://github.com/zonemaster) (`Zonemaster::Engine`
  version v4.7.3). Test case IDs from this document can be mapped to the
  Zonemaster test IDs by removing the `dns-` or `dnssec-` prefix.

  Since Zonemaster is designed to perform testing of domain names anywhere in
  the DNS hierarchy, not all Zonemaster tests are applicable for TLDs and may
  not be listed in the test suites in this document.

  StandardPreDelegationTest:
    Order: 1
    Name: Standard Pre-Delegation Test Plan
    Description: |
      The purpose of the Pre-Delegation Test is to verify that the applicant has
      met its commitment to establish registry operations in accordance with the
      technical and operational criteria described in the gTLD Applicant
      Guidebook (AGB). Each applicant will be required to complete PDT as a
      prerequisite to delegation into the root zone.

      The Pre-Delegation Test covers all critical registry services and IDNs,
      and therefore uses all test suites.

    Description: |
      A Registry Operator may apply to ICANN to change a Material Subcontracting

      instead of or in addition to any existing provider(s).

      Before this change can be approved, the new DNS provider must complete
      testing to ensure their systems comply with the technical and operational
      requirements of the Registry Agreement.

  IDNTest:

    Name: IDN RST Test Plan
    Description: |
      A Registry Operator may apply to ICANN to amend its Registry Agreement
      to offer new scripts and/or languages for Internationalized Domain Names.

      The purpose of an IDN RST test is to verify that the Registry Operator’s
      registry system handles IDN registrations in accordance with the
      submitted policy statements and IDN tables.

      The IDN Test uses the IDN test suite only.

  SRSGatewayTest:
    Order: 5
    Name: SRS Gateway Test Plan
    Description: |
      An SRS Gateway service is a Shared Registry System implementation that
      acts as a proxy between a subset of Registrars and the Registry. It uses
      a local cache to speed up EPP query commands, but forwards all EPP
      transform commands to the TLD Registry System. TLD registries need to
      deploy a proxy setup in order to operate in certain markets worldwide.

      The purpose of an SRS Gateway Test is to verify that the Registry
      Operator’s proxy setup operates in accordance with the technical and
      operational criteria for EPP systems described in the gTLD Applicant
      Guidebook (AGB). Furthermore, it must keep its own database synchronized
      with that of the TLD registry.

      The SRS Gateway Test Change Test uses the RDDS and EPP test suites.

  StandardRSPEvaluationTest:

    Name: Standard RSP Evaluation Test
    Description: |
      For the Next Round of gTLD applications, Registry Service Providers can
      apply to be pre-evaluated before submission of applications.

      A "Standard" RSP is one which provides all of the critical registry
      services.

      As a result, this test plan is designed to cover all aspects of RSP
      operations, and is substantially similar to the Standard Pre-Delegation
      Test and Standard RSP Change Test.
