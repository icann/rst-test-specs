Preamble: |
  This file describes each test [plan](#test-plans), [suite](#test-suites) and
  [case](#test-cases) in the RST system, as well as the
  [input parameters](#input-parameters) required for each, relevant
  [resources](#resources), any inter-case dependencies, and the
  [errors](#errors) that might occur during testing.

  # 2.1. Test plans

  An individual *Test Plan* addresses a particular scenario (for example, RSP
  evaluation or Pre-Delegation Testing). Each plan consists of one or more *test
  suites*, which in turn include one or more *test cases*.

  # 2.2. Test suites

  A *Test Suite* is a collection of *test cases* with a common theme or subject
  matter, for example, Authoritative DNS or Registry Data Escrow.

  # 2.3. Test cases

  A *Test Case* describes a process for determining the conformance or
  acceptability of a certain element of the system.

  A test case consists of a *test procedure* which accepts zero or more **input
  parameters**, and generates one or more **test results**.

  ## 2.3.1. Input parameters

  All test cases require some information about the subject of the test, for
  example, service hostnames, credentials, and functional parameters. These
  *input parameters* may be shared across multiple test cases.

  ## 2.3.2. Test results

  Test cases will generate one or more *test results*. Test results indicate the
  outcome of the test and other relevant information.

  ## 2.3.3. General pass/fail criteria

  In general, for a test to pass, **all** the test cases specified in the test
  suite(s) for the test plan must pass: if *any* fail, then the test as a
  whole will fail.

  A test case will fail if it produces one or more [errors](#errors) with the
  `ERROR` or `CRITICAL` severities.

  ## 2.3.4. Error severity levels

  1. `ERROR` - an issue which prevents the test from *passing*, but does not
     prevent the test from *continuing*. A test may produce multiple `ERROR`
     results.
  2. `CRITICAL` - an issue which prevents the test from continuing any
     further. A test will only produce a single `CRITICAL` result and it
     will always be the last result in the log.

  ## 2.3.5. Common errors

  For each test case, various errors and critical errors are defined which will
  be used to signal why that the case might have failed.

  In addition to these, there are a number of errors which any test case may
  produce, which are:

  * [TBA]

  SRSGatewayTest:
    Order: 5
    Name: SRS Gateway Test
    Description: |
      An SRS Gateway service is a Shared Registry System implementation that
      acts as a proxy between a subset of Registrars and the Registry. It uses
      a local cache to speed up EPP query commands, but forwards all EPP
      transform commands to the primary registry system. TLD registries need to
      deploy a proxy setup in order to operate in certain markets worldwide.

      The purpose of an SRS Gateway Test is to verify that the Registry
      Operator’s proxy setup operates in accordance with the technical and
      operational criteria for EPP systems described in the gTLD Applicant
      Guidebook (AGB). Furthermore, it MUST keep its own database synchronized
      with that of the TLD registry.

      The SRS Gateway Test Change Test uses the SRS gateway test suite only.

      # Pass/fail criteria

      As with all other [test plans](#test-plans), for this test to pass, **all** the listed test cases must pass: if **any** fail, then the test as a whole will fail.

    Name: Authoritative DNS Service
    Description: |
      The DNS test suite validates the authoritative DNS services for the TLD
      or RSP.

      The DNS test suite is derived from the test plans in version
      **v2023.1.4
      ** of [Zonemaster](https://github.com/zonemaster). Test
      case IDs from this document can be mapped to the Zonemaster test IDs by
      removing the `dns-` prefix.

      Since Zonemaster is designed to perform testing of domain names anywhere in the DNS hierarchy, not all Zonemaster tests are applicable for TLDs and may not be listed in the test suites in this document.

      # Testing of Anycast networks using multiple vantage points

      In order to test anycast networks without requiring RSPs to provide the
      unicast adresses of their nodes, tests carried out over the network will
      be performed from multiple vantage points. All vantage points MUST receive
      the same response in order for the tests to pass.

      # Pass/fail criteria

      As with all other [test suites](#test-suites), for this test suite to pass **all** the listed test cases must pass: if **any** fail, then the suite as a whole will fail.

      Unless stated otherwise, the pass/fail criteria for the test cases in this suite are the same as those defined in the Zonemaster documentation: that is, if Zonemaster reports that a test case has an `ERROR` or `CRITICAL` result, then the corresponding test case in this suite will fail. `NOTICE` and `WARNING` results will not result in a failed test case. Error codes in this suite are prefixed with `ZM_` which map onto the message tags used by Zonemaster.

      # Objective
  
      In order for the domain and its resources to be accessible,
      authoritative name servers must have addresses in the routable public
      addressing space.
  
      IANA is responsible for global coordination of the IP addressing system.
      Aside its address allocation activities, it maintains reserved address
      ranges for special uses. These ranges can be categorized into three
      types : [Special purpose IPv4
      addresses](https://www.iana.org/assignments/iana-ipv4-special-registry/iana-ipv4-special-registry.xml),
      [Special purpose IPv6

      and [Multicast reserved
      addresses](https://www.iana.org/assignments/multicast-addresses/multicast-addresses.xml).
  
      # Pass/fail criteria
  
      If one name server has one of its addresses matches a forbidden address
      block, the test fails. If all the name server addresses are outside
      these forbidden blocks, the test case succeeds.

      Moreover, as mentioned in paragraph 2.1 of [RFC
      1912](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc1912) when a PTR record
      exists, it must match the host name.
  
      # Pass/fail criteria
  
      Multiple addresses and multiple PTR records are allowed. The test
      succeeds if every name server address has one or more PTR records and
      one of these records matches the server name. If one address doesn't
      match, the whole test case fails.
    Errors: []
    Summary: Reverse DNS entry matches name server name

    Description: "This test case comes from version v2023.1.4 of Zonemaster. For more\ninformation,

      Objective\n\nUDP is the fundamental protocol to reach a general purpose name server\nhosting
      a zone, \"DNS servers MUST be able to service UDP \\[...\\]\" ([RFC\n1123](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc1123),
      section 6.1.3.2, page\n75), also restated in [RFC\n7766](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc7766#section-5),
      section 5.\n\nThis Test Case will verify if the name servers of *Child Zone* are\nreachable
      over UDP. The name servers tested are both those in the\ndelegation of *Child
      Zone* and those in the NS records in the *Child\nZone* itself.\n\nMost Zonemaster
      Test Cases will query the name servers in the delegation\nor the name servers
      appointed by the NS records in the zone for the NS\nor SOA record, or both. It
      is crucial that problems are reported, but\ninstead of letting several Test Cases
      report the same problems found,\nmost Test Cases assume that this test case is
      run. Only this Test Case\nwill report problems found in the following areas over
      UDP:\n\n-   Name Server not responding to a query without EDNS.\n-   Name Server
      not including SOA record of *Child Zone* in the answer\n    section in the response
      on a SOA query for *Child Zone*.\n-   Name Server not including NS record of *Child
      Zone* in the answer\n    section in the response on an NS query for *Child Zone*.\n-
      \  Name Server not setting the AA flag in a response with SOA or NS in\n    answer
      section.\n-   Name Server responding with unexpected [RCODE\n    Name](https://www.iana.org/assignments/dns-parameters/dns-parameters.xhtml#dns-parameters-6)\n
      \   (any except \"NoError\") on query for SOA or NS for *Child Zone*.\n\nIn addition,
      this test case will output a message if transport over IPv4\nor IPv6 has been
      disabled.\n\n# Summary\n\n  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n

      # Objective
  
      The objective in this test is to verify that all IP addresses of the
      domain's authoritative name servers are announced from different ASNs
      (autonomous system number). See [RFC
      1930](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc1930) and
      [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autonomous_system_(Internet))
      for an explanation of AS (autonomous system).
  
      This test is done separately on IPv4 and IPv6, and both must match the
      criterion.
  
      [RFC 2182](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc2182#section-3.1),
      section 3.1, clearly specifies that distinct authoritative name servers
      for a child domain should be placed in different topological and
      geographical locations. The objective is to minimise the likelihood of a
      single failure disabling all of them.
  
      # Pass/fail criteria
  
      The outcome of this Test Case is "fail" if there is at least one message
      with the severity level ERROR or CRITICAL.
  
      The outcome of this Test Case is "warning" if there is at least one
      message with the severity level WARNING, but no message with severity
      level ERROR or CRITICAL.
  
      In other cases the outcome of this Test Case is "pass".

      # Objective
  
      For the data served by the authoritative name servers for a designated
      zone to be consistent, all authoritative name servers must serve the
      same SOA record for the designated zone.
  
      If the serial number (explained in 3.3.13. of [RFC
      1035](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc1035)), which is part of
      the SOA record, is not consistent between authoritative servers, there
      is a possibility that the data served is inconsistent. The reasons for
      this inconsistency may be different - such as misconfiguration, or as a
      result of slow propagation to the secondary name servers.
  
      The objective of this test is to verify that the serial number is
      consistent between different authoritative name servers.
  
      For reference purposes : [RFC
      1982](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc1982) explains the serial
      number arithmetic, and section 4.3.5 of [RFC

      4.2.1) of [RFC 1034](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc1035) for
      the tested domain. As per section 3.3.13 of [RFC
      1035](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc1035) the MNAME field in
      the SOA RDATA refers to the name of "the name server that was the
      original or primary source of data for this zone". Inconsistency in
      MNAME of the domain might result in operational failures for
      applications that uses MNAME.

      # Objective
  
      Section 4.1 of [RFC 1034](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc1034)
      specifies that there must be a minimum of two name servers for a domain.
      This test is done to verify this condition.
  
      The RFC ([RFC 1034](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc1034))
      predates IPv6. Since IPv4 and IPv6 work as separate networks, this test
      case has been extended to test for two name servers that resolve into
      IPv4 addresses and IPv6 addresses respectively.
  
      Both [RFC 3901](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc3901) (section
      3) and [RFC 4472](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc4472)
      (section 1.3) states that a domain (zone) should be available over IPv4
      for the time being. Therefore, it is by the default level in this test
      case considered to be more problematic not being available over IPv4
      than not being available over IPv6.
  
      # Pass/fail criteria
  
      The outcome of this Test Case is "fail" if there is at least one message
      with the severity level *ERROR* or *CRITICAL*.
  
      The outcome of this Test Case is "warning" if there is at least one
      message with the severity level *WARNING*, but no message with severity
      level *ERROR* or *CRITICAL*.
  
      Else the outcome of this Test Case is "pass".

      # Objective
  
      If the domain's name servers use several different names, they can all
      be using the same IP address. This may be due to a configuration error,
      or a workaround for a certain policy restriction. This test case checks
      that the name servers used do not reuse the same IP addresses.
  
      Section 4.1 of [RFC 1034](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc1034)
      says at least two name servers must be used for a delegation.
  
      # Pass/fail criteria
  
      The outcome of this Test Case is "fail" if there is at least one message
      with the severity level *ERROR* or *CRITICAL*.

      # Objective
  
      The Domain Name System defaults to using UDP for queries and answers
      with a DNS payload limit of 512 octets (bytes). Larger replies cause an
      initial truncation indication leading to a subsequent handling via TCP
      with substantially higher overhead. EDNS0 is used to allow for larger
      UDP responses thus reducing the need for use of TCP.
  
      But [IANA](https://www.iana.org/help/nameserver-requirements) still
      maintains that referrals from the parent zone name servers must fit into
      a non-EDNS0 UDP DNS packet.
  
      # Pass/fail criteria
  
      The outcome of this Test Case is "fail" if there is at least one message
      with the severity level *ERROR* or *CRITICAL*.
  
      The outcome of this Test Case is "warning" if there is at least one
      message with the severity level *WARNING*, but no message with severity

      # Objective
  
      Subsection 6.1 of [RFC
      2181](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc2181) specifies that the
      nameservers must answer authoritatively for the domain. Answers to
      queries to the name servers for the designated zone must have the "AA"
      bit set.
  
      # Pass/fail criteria

      # Objective
  
      Name servers for a zone are defined in NS records. An NS record points
      at a name, i.e. the RDATA for an NS record is a domain name. That name
      is the name of the name server. [RFC
      2181](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc2181#section-10.3),
      section 10.3, states that the name of the name server must not itself
      point at a CNAME.
  
      The objective of this test is to verify that name servers of the tested
      domain (zone) do not point at CNAME records.
  
      # Pass/fail criteria
  
      The outcome of this Test Case is "fail" if there is at least one message
      with the severity level *ERROR* or *CRITICAL*.
  
      The outcome of this Test Case is "warning" if there is at least one
      message with the severity level *WARNING*, but no message with severity

      Section 6.1 of the [RFC
      2181](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc2181) specifies that the
      SOA record is mandatory for every zone.
  
      This test is intended to verify the prescence of a SOA record for the
      domain.

      # Objective
  
      To ensure consistency in DNS, an authoritative name server should not be
      configured to do recursive lookups. Also, open recursive resolvers are
      considered bad internet practice due to their capability of assisting in
      large scale DDoS attacks. The introduction to [RFC
      5358](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc5358) elaborates on
      mixing recursor and authoritative functionality, and the issue is
      further elaborated by [D.J.
      Bernstein](https://cr.yp.to/djbdns/separation.html).
  
      Section 2.5 of [RFC 2870](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc2870)
      have very specific requirement on disabling recursion functionality on
      root name servers.
  
      # Pass/fail criteria
  
      The outcome of this Test Case is "fail" if there is at least one message

      # Objective
  
      EDNS(0) is a mechanism to announce capabilities of a DNS implementation,
      and is now basically required by any new functionality in DNS such as
      DNSSEC. EDNS(0) is standardized in [RFC
      6891](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6891).
  
      This test case checks that all name servers has the capability to do
      EDNS(0) or if not, correctly replies to queries containing EDNS (OPT
      record).
  
      Servers not supporting EDNS(0) must return FORMERR ([RFC 6891, section
      7](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6891#section-7)):
  
      > Responders that choose not to implement the protocol extensions
      > defined in this document MUST respond with a return code (RCODE) of
      > FORMERR to messages containing an OPT record in the additional section
      > and MUST NOT include an OPT record in the response.
  
      Servers supporting EDNS(0) must reply with EDNS(0) ([RFC 6891, section
      6.1.1](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6891#section-6.1.1)):
  
      > If an OPT record is present in a received request, compliant
      > responders MUST include an OPT record in their respective responses.
  
      To eliminating the risk of falsely classifying the server as not
      supporting EDNS due e.g. firewall issues, the UDP buffer size is set to
      512 bytes (octets).
  
      # Pass/fail criteria
  
      The outcome of this Test Case is "fail" if there is at least one message

      # Objective
  
      AXFR is a mechanism to transfer the whole content of a zone from a name
      server. Some people prefer to not disclose the whole content of a zone
      for various reasons, and thus wants the public name server
      infrastructure not do disclose the whole zone content to the public.
      This test case checks the availability of the AXFR mechanism.

      # Objective
  
      All name servers names listed for a delegation must be resolvable in
      DNS. If they are not resolvable using DNS this is a sign of
      misconfiguration, and raises the risk of unreachability for the domain.
      It could also lower the performance for any resolver trying to resolve
      the name.
  
      The objective of this test is to resolve the domain using all the listed
      name servers used in the delegation. More information about resolver
      behavior is in section 7 of [RFC
      1035](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc1035).

      # Objective
  
      The DNS standards require that nameservers treat names with case
      insensitivity. That is, the names example.com and EXAMPLE.COM should
      resolve to the same IP address. However, in the response, most
      nameservers echo back the name as it appeared in the request, preserving
      the original case.
  
      Therefore, another way to add entropy to requests is to randomly vary
      the case of letters in domain names queried. This technique, also known
      as "0x20" because bit 0x20 is used to set the case of of US-ASCII
      letters, was first proposed in the [IETF internet
      draft](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/draft-vixie-dnsext-dns0x20-00)
      Use of Bit 0x20 in DNS Labels to Improve Transaction Identity. With this
      technique, the nameserver response must match not only the query name,
      but the case of every letter in the name string; for example,
      wWw.eXaMpLe.CoM or WwW.ExamPLe.COm. This may add little or no entropy to
      queries for the top-level and root domains, but it's effective for most
      hostnames.

      # Objective
  
      There has been cases where the nameservers respond with complete
      case-sensitivity (in violation of the DNS standards): that is, they
      match the exact case of the name in the response; but return different
      results for equivalent names with different cases in the request
      (typically NXDOMAIN).
  
      # Pass/fail criteria
  
      The test case passes only if the results of all queries are exactly the
      same.

      This test case comes from version v2023.1.4 of Zonemaster. For more

      <https://github.com/zonemaster/zonemaster/blob/v2023.1.4/docs/public/specifications/tests/Zone-TP/zone01.md>.
  
      # Objective
  
      The MNAME field from the SOA record of a zone is supposed to contain the
      master name server for that zone. The hostname of the MNAME field may
      not be listed in the NS records in the zone among the delegated name
      servers, but should still be authoritative for the zone. MNAME may be
      used for other services such as DNS NOTIFY described in
      [RFC1996](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc1996#section-2).
  
      [RFC1035](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc1035#section-3.3.13),
      section 3.3.13, specifies that "the *domain-name* of the name server
      that was the original or primary source of data for this zone".
  
      [RFC1996](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc1996#section-2),
      section 2, and
      [RFC2136](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc2136#section-1),
      section 1, add that "the primary master is named in the zone's SOA MNAME
      field and optionally by an NS RR. There is by definition only one
      primary master server per zone".
  
      [RFC2181](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc2181#section-7.3),
      section 7.2, clarifies that "it is quite clear in the specifications,
      yet seems to have been widely ignored, that the MNAME field of the SOA
      record should contain the name of the primary (master) server for the
      zone identified by the SOA. It should not contain the name of the zone
      itself. That information would be useless, as to discover it, one needs
      to start with the domain name of the SOA record - that is the name of
      the zone".
  
      There exists an unstandardized practice to set the SOA MNAME to ".",
      which should not be interpreted that there is no primary master server,
      but to indicate that there is no default server for dynamic updates.
      With ".", SOA MNAME has no server name. There is at least one old and
      expired Internet-Draft that attempted to standardize that behavior,
      [draft-jabley-dnsop-missing-mname](https://www.ietf.org/archive/id/draft-jabley-dnsop-missing-mname-00.html).
      If the SOA MNAME is an empty name (".") this Test Case will not try to
      connect to a server behind it since there will never be a server behind
      that name, as the purpose is most definitely to follow that practice.
      Instead, a special message will be outputted.
  
      This Test Case will check that: - the SOA MNAME contains the master name
      server of *Child Zone*, as best as it can be determined. - the SOA MNAME
      name server is authoritative of *Child Zone*. - the SOA SERIAL of the
      SOA MNAME is at least equal to the ones found from the name servers in
      the NS record set of *Child Zone*. This comparison must be done
      following [RFC1982](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc1982). -
      the SOA MNAME name server is listed as part of the NS record set of
      *Child Zone*.

      # Objective
  
      The SOA refresh value is the number of seconds that describes how often
      a secondary name server will poll the primary name server to see if
      there is any updates. The SOA refresh value is described in section
      3.3.13 in [RFC 1035](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc1035), and
      clarified in section 2.2 of [RFC
      1912](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc1912). Setting the
      refresh value low will increase the DNS traffic between the servers, and
      also increase the load on the master name server. The primary name
      server will in most cases send DNS notifications to tell the secondary
      name servers that zone content has been updated, as described in [RFC
      1996](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc1996).
  
      The [RIPE-203](https://www.ripe.net/publications/docs/ripe-203)
      recommendation for the refresh value is 24 hours (86400 seconds). Older
      DNSCheck code had a four hour minimum value, and this is the minimum

      # Objective
  
      The SOA expire value specifies for how long any secondary name server
      keeps the zone valid without any contact with the primary name server.
      This value should be greater than how long a major outage would

      and retry values, as described in section 3.3.13 in [RFC

      Setting the expire value low will increase the risk of any unwanted

      # Objective
  
      The SOA minimum field sets the default TTL for all records in a zone.
      The recommended value is to be "cache-friendly". However, for a zone
      that changes content often, there is a need to keep the TTL values
      shorter. The use of the SOA minimum value today is the negative cache
      (where a resolver find content is missing).
  
      The SOA minimum field is described in section 3.3.13 in [RFC

      should be present at the top of the zone" ([RFC
      1035](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc1035#section-5.2),
      section 5.2). This test case will verify that the zone of the domain to
      be tested return exactly one SOA record.
  
      # Pass/fail criteria
  
      The outcome of this Test Case is "fail" if there is at least one message
      with the severity level *ERROR* or *CRITICAL*.
  
      The outcome of this Test Case is "warning" if there is at least one
      message with the severity level *WARNING*, but no message with severity
      level *ERROR* or *CRITICAL*.
  
      In other cases the outcome of this Test Case is "pass".

      # Objective
  
      DNS delegations from a parent to a child are secured with DNSSEC by
      publishing one or several Delegation Signer (DS) records in the parent
      zone, along with the NS records for the delegation.
  
      For the secure delegation to work, at least one DS record must match a
      DNSKEY record in the child zone ([RFC
      4035](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc4035#section-5), section
      5). Each DS record should match a DNSKEY record in the child zone. More
      than one DS may match the same DNSKEY. The DNSKEY that the DS record
      refer to must be used to sign the DNSKEY RRset in the child zone ([RFC
      4035](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc4035#section-5), section
      5).
  
      The DNSKEY record that the DS record refer to must have bit 7 ("Zone Key
      flag") set in the DNSKEY RR Flags ([RFC
      4034](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc4034#section-5.2),
      section 5.2).
  
      Bit 15 ("Secure Entry Point flag") on a DNSKEY record signals that it is
      meant to be a KSK and pointed out by a DS record. It is noted if the
      DNSKEY record that the DS points at does not have that flag set ([RFC
      4034](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc4034#section-2.1.1),
      section 2.1.1).
  
      # Summary
  
      -   Both DS record and DNSKEY record must be found, or else no further
          investigation will be done and no messages will be outputted.
      -   No messages will be outputted due to errors in the responses from
          the parent name servers.

      # Objective
  
      Having RRSIG signature lifetimes last for too long opens up for DNS
      replay attacks. Having too short RRSIG signature lifetimes is likely to
      have a major operational impact if the master name server is down for
      that long.
  
      There is no clear recommendation of the exact validity periods to use
      with DNSSEC. Shorter validity than 12 hours until expiration will give a
      serious operational problem just in case of temporary network problems,
      and longer than 180 days will create wide open holes for replay attacks.
  
      The considerations are described in
      [RFC6781](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6781).
  
      # Pass/fail criteria
  
      If any of the signature expirations time is either shorter than 12 hours
      or longer than 180 days, this test case fails.

      # Objective
  
      The DNSKEYs based on RSA have different minimum and maximum key sizes,
      which must be followed. This test case will validate the keys size of
      such keys. RSA based algorithms that are deprecated or else not suitable
      for DNSKEY ([RFC
      8624](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8624.html#section-3.1) and [IANA
      registry](https://www.iana.org/assignments/dns-sec-alg-numbers/dns-sec-alg-numbers.xml))
      are just ignored. See test case [DNSSEC05](./dnssec05.md) for test of
      algorithm.
  
      The table 1 below specify the maximum and minimum key size,
      respectively. Algorithm number can be found in [IANA
      registry](https://www.iana.org/assignments/dns-sec-alg-numbers/dns-sec-alg-numbers.xml).

      It is also recommended that an RSA based algorithm has a key length of
      at least 2048 bit as stated in [NIST SP 800-57 Part 1
      Rev. 4](https://csrc.nist.gov/publications/detail/sp/800-57-part-1/rev-4/archive/2016-01-28),

      This test case verifies that RSA DNSKEYs follows the stated key lengths
      from the RFCs and also the NIST recommended shortest key length.

      # Objective
  
      CDS and CDNSKEY record types are defined in [RFC
      7344](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7344) and [RFC
      8078](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc8078). Both record types
      are optional in a zone. The objective of this test case is to verify
      that they are correctly set-up, if included in the zone.
  
      If a CDS record is included in the zone, the corresponding CDNSKEY
      record should also be included ([RFC
      7344](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7344#section-4), section
      4).
  
      The CDS and CDNSKEY RRsets should be consistent between all name servers
      for the zone in question.
  
      If there are both CDS RRs and CDNSKEY RRs in the zone they must match in
      content ([RFC
      7344](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7344#section-4), section
      4). It means that both must be derived from the same DNSKEY or both
      being "delete" CDS and CDNSKEY.

      # Objective
  
      CDS and CDNSKEY record types are defined in [RFC
      7344](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7344) and [RFC
      8078](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc8078). Both record types
      are optional in a zone. The objective of this test case is to verify
      that the CDNSKEY RRset is valid. This test case is only relevant if the
      zone has at least one CDNSKEY record. For tests of the CDS, see test
      case [DNSSEC16](dnssec16.md).
  
      # Summary
  
      -   If no CDNSKEY record is found, the test case will terminate early
          with no message tag outputted.
      -   If a CDNSKEY record is of "delete" type, then it can by definition
          not match or point at any DNSKEY record.

      This Test case is only relevant if \* The *Child Zone* has either CDS or
      CDNSKEY record or both, and \* The parent zone has a DS RRset for the
      *Child Zone*.

  dnssecOps01-ZSKRollover:
    Summary: ZSK rollover
    Description: |
      This test case verifies the RSP's ability to perform a ZSK rollover (as
      described in [Section 4.1.1 of
      RFC6781](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6781#section-4.1.1) for
      a zone.

      If the value of the `dnssecOps.csk` input parameter is `true`, then this
      test will be skipped.

      The system will monitor the SOA record in the domain name specified in the
      `dnssec.zskRolloverZone` input parameter. The domain may be present
      anywhere in the DNS hierarchy (that is, it does not need to be a TLD), but
      MUST have a secure chain of trust up to the root zone, so that it can be
      validated using the root zone trust anchor.

      During the test period (currently defined as 24 hours) the operator MUST
      successfully carry out a ZSK rollover for the domain, where the Zone
      Signing Key is replaced, without disrupting the chain of trust.

      To simplify testing, applicants may wish to provision domain that is
      configured with short TTLs and a short ZSK lifetime, so that a ZSK
      rollover is guaranteed to occur within the 24 test period.
    Input-Parameters:
      - dnssecOps.csk
      - dnssecOps.zskRolloverZone
    Dependencies:
  dnssecOps02-KSKRollover:
    Summary: KSK rollover
    Description: |
      This test case verifies the RSP's ability to perform a CSK/KSK rollover
      (as described in [Sections 4.1.2 and 4.13 of
      RFC6781](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6781#section-4.1.2) for
      a zone.

      The system will monitor the SOA record in the domain name specified in the
      `dnssec.kskRolloverZone` input parameter. The domain may be present
      anywhere in the DNS hierarchy (that is, it does not need to be a TLD), but
      MUST have a secure chain of trust up to the root zone, so that it can be
      validated using the root zone trust anchor.

      During the test period (currently defined as 24 hours) the operator MUST
      successfully carry out a KSK rollover for the domain, where the Key
      Signing Key is replaced, and the DS record in the parent zone is updated,
      without disrupting the chain of trust.
    Input-Parameters:
      - dnssecOps.kskRolloverZone
    Dependencies:
  dnssecOps03-AlgorithmRollover:
    Summary: algorithm rollover
    Description: |
      This test case verifies the RSP's ability to perform an algorithm rollover
      (as described in [Section 4.1.4 of
      RFC6781](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6781#section-4.1.2) for
      a zone.

      The system will monitor the SOA record in the domain name specified in the
      `dnssec.algorithmRolloverZone` input parameter. The domain may be present
      anywhere in the DNS hierarchy (that is, it does not need to be a TLD), but
      MUST have a secure chain of trust up to the root zone, so that it can be
      validated using the root zone trust anchor.

      During the test period (currently defined as 72 hours) the operator MUST
      successfully carry out an algorithm rollover for the domain (including an
      update to the DS record in the parent zone), where the algorithm used to
      secure the domain is changed, without disrupting the chain of trust.

      Note that the specific algorithms being rolled to and from are not
      significant (although they must be present in the IANA registry); it is
      not required that the new algorithm be more "secure" than the original
      algorithm; only that they are different. So a rollover from algorithm 13
      (`ECDSAP256SHA256`) to algorithm 8 (`RSASHA256`) will be accepted as well
      as a rollover from `RSASHA256` to `ECDSAP256SHA256`.

      object (containing pseudo-random contact information) will be created
      beforehand and used as the registrant. If the `epp.hostModel` parameter is
      `objects`, then two host objects with pseudo-random names will be created
      and used as the nameservers (otherwise the names will be provided as
      attributes).

      The client will perform several `<create>` commands, each of which will
      test certain aspects of the server's processing of those commands, for
      example:

        * to confirm that the server does not accept invalid values for object
          properties (such as domain name, registration period, registant ID,
          nameservers, DS record parameters, etc)
        * to confirm that the server does not accept commands which reference
          non-existent host/contact objects
        * to confirm the server supports all permitted client-assigned status
          codes
        * to confirm that the server rejects a `<create>` command which
          specifies a contact object (where the `general.minimalPublicDataSet`)
          input parameter is `true`
        * to confirm that the server rejects a `<create>` command which does not
          specify a contact object (where the `general.minimalPublicDataSet`)
          input parameter is `false`
        * to confirm that the server rejects a `<create>` command containing
          host objects when the `epp.hostModel` parameter is `attributes`
        * to confirm that the server rejects a `<create>` command containing
          host attributes when the `epp.hostModel` parameter is `objects`
        * to confirm that the the server which implements RFC9154 accepts a
          `<create>` command without an authInfo command.

    Description: |
      This test will confirm that the client is able to initiate a domain
      transfer.

      The client will perform an `<update>` command to set the authInfo code for
      the test domain (taken from the set created in `epp-32`) to a
      randomly-determined value.

      Then, using a second set of credentials, the client will connect to the
      EPP server and authenticate, submit `<transfer>` commands, and validate
      the responses.

      This test will confirm that:

      * the server rejects a `<transfer>` command with an invalid authInfo code
      * the server rejects a command which would extend the domain's validity
        period more than 10 years into the future
      * the server accepts a `<transfer>` command with a valid authInfo code
        and period.

      Once the transfer request has been accepted, the sponsoring client will
      wait for a message to be received on the server's message queue, and will
      then approve the transfer.

      Once the gaining registrar has also received a message on the queue, the
      client will confirm that:

      * the domain is now under the sponsorship of the gaining registrar
      * the authInfo code has been reset by the server (if the server supports
        RFC9154).

      3.3.1 of RFC8334.

      For this test, it is assumed that the EPP server has been configured to
      use data (specifically the Domain Name Label List, as described in Section
      5.3.3.1 of RFC9361) from the TMCH test environment.

      The client will connect to the EPP server and will submit `<create>`
      commands, using domain names and SMD files present in the TMCH test
      environment.

      If the server supports Start Date sunrises, the fully-qualified domain
      name will be constructed using a label from the SMD file and the
      `zz--edsct` TLD (eg `example.zz-edsct`). The Server MUST respond with a
      1000 or 1001 result code, however, if the client receives a 2302 "object
      exists" result code, it will retry with a different domain name.

      The client will also attempt to create a domain using an invalid SMD,
      which the server MUST reject.

      If the server supports End Date sunrises, the fully-qualified domain
      name will be constructed using a label from the SMD file and the
      `zz-sdsct` TLD (eg `example.zz-sdsct`). The Server MUST respond with a
      1000 or 1001 result code.

      The client will also attempt to create a domain using an invalid SMD,
      which the server MUST reject.
