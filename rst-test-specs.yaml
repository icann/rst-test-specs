Preamble: |
  The Test System consists of several *test plans*, each of which addresses a
  particular scenario. The test plans follow a standard structure and
  methodology derived from ISO/IEC 29119 *(formerly IEEE 829-2008)*.

  Each *test plan* includes one or more *test suites*, which in turn include
  one or more *test cases*. For a test to succeed, every test case has to pass.

  This file describes each test plan, suite and case in the RST system.

  ### 2.1. Key acronyms and terms

Test-Plans:
  StandardPreDelegationTest:
    Order: 1
    Name: Pre-Delegation Test
    Description: |
      The purpose of the Pre-Delegation Test is to verify that the applicant has
      met its commitment to establish registry operations in accordance with the
      technical and operational criteria described in the gTLD Applicant
      Guidebook (AGB). Each applicant will be required to complete PDT as a
      prerequisite to delegation into the root zone.

      The Pre-Delegation Test covers all critical registry services and IDNs,
      and therefore uses all test suites.
    Test-Suites:
      - StandardDNS
      - StandardDNSSEC
      - StandardEPP
      - StandardRDDS
      - StandardIDN
      - StandardRDE

  StandardRSPChangeTest:
    Order: 2
    Name: RSP Change Test
    Description: |
      A Registry Operator may apply to ICANN to change a Material Subcontracting
      Arrangement (MSA) and appoint a new Registry Services Provider. Before
      this change can be approved, the new RSP must complete Registry System
      Testing to ensure their systems comply with the technical and operational
      requirements of the Registry Agreement.

      The RSP Change Test covers all critical registry services and IDNs, and
      therefore uses all test suites.
    Test-Suites:
      - StandardDNS
      - StandardDNSSEC
      - StandardEPP
      - StandardIDN
      - StandardRDDS
      - StandardRDE

  DNSRSPChangeTest:
    Order: 3
    Name: DNS RSP Change Test
    Description: |
      A Registry Operator may apply to ICANN to change a Material Subcontracting
      Arrangement (MSA) and appoint a new provider of authoritative DNS services
      instead of or in addition to any existing provider(s).

      Before this change can be approved, the new DNS provider must complete
      testing to ensure their systems comply with the technical and operational
      requirements of the Registry Agreement.

      The DNS RSP Change Test uses the DNS test suite only.
    Test-Suites:
      - StandardDNS
      - StandardDNSSEC

  IDNTest:
    Order: 4
    Name: IDN Test
    Description: |
      A Registry Operator may apply to ICANN to amend its Registry Agreement
      to offer new scripts and/or languages for Internationalized Domain Names.

      The purpose of an IDN RST test is to verify that the Registry Operator’s
      registry system handles IDN registrations in accordance with the
      submitted policy statements and IDN tables.

      The IDN Test uses the IDN test suite only.
    Test-Suites:
      - StandardIDN

  SRSGatewayTest:
    Order: 5
    Name: SRS Gateway Test
    Description: |
      An SRS Gateway service is a Shared Registry System implementation that
      acts as a proxy between a subset of Registrars and the Registry. It uses
      a local cache to speed up EPP query commands, but forwards all EPP
      transform commands to the TLD Registry System. TLD registries need to
      deploy a proxy setup in order to operate in certain markets worldwide.

      The purpose of an SRS Gateway Test is to verify that the Registry
      Operator’s proxy setup operates in accordance with the technical and
      operational criteria for EPP systems described in the gTLD Applicant
      Guidebook (AGB). Furthermore, it must keep its own database synchronized
      with that of the TLD registry.

      The SRS Gateway Test Change Test uses the RDDS and EPP test suites.
    Test-Suites:
      - StandardSRSGateway

  MainRSPEvaluationTest:
    Order: 6
    Name: Main RSP Evaluation Test
    Description: |
      The Main RSP is responsible for the creation and maintenance of domain
      name registrations in a Shared Registration System (SRS). This encompasses
      the lifecycle of a domain name registration using domain registrars and
      protocols such as the Extensible Provisioning Protocol (EPP) and adherence
      to policies regarding the use and transparency domain name registrations
      through reporting, the Registration Data Access Protocol (RDAP), and other
      mechanisms.

    Test-Suites:
      - StandardEPP
      - LaunchExtensionAndTMCH
      - StandardIDN
      - StandardRDDS
      - StandardRDE

  DNSRSPEvaluationTest:
    Order: 7
    Name: DNS RSP Evaluation Test
    Description: |
      DNS RSPs provide primary or secondary authoritative DNS services.
      Therefore, this test plan only covers the DNS area.

      RSPs wishing to offer DNSSEC services in addition to authoritative DNS
      will also be evaluated using the DNSSEC RSP Evaluation Test below.
    Test-Suites:
      - StandardDNS

  DNSSECRSPEvaluationTest:
    Order: 8
    Name: DNSSEC RSP Evaluation Test
    Description: |
      DNSSEC RSPs provide signing of TLD zone files as a service. They do not
      provide primary or secondary authoritative DNS services.

      RSPs wishing to offer DNSSEC services in addition to authoritative DNS
      will also be evaluated using the DNSSEC RSP Evaluation Test below.
    Test-Suites:
      - StandardDNSSEC
      - DNSSECOperations

  SRSGatewayRSPTest:
    Order: 9
    Name: SRS Gateway RSP Evaluation Test
    Description: |
      SRS Gateway RSPs provide a proxy between a subset of Registrars and the
      Registry. It uses a local cache to speed up EPP query commands, but
      forwards all EPP transform commands to the TLD Registry System. TLD
      registries need to deploy a proxy setup in order to operate in certain
      markets worldwide.
    Test-Suites:
      - StandardSRSGateway

Test-Suites:
  StandardDNS:
    Order: 1
    Name: Authoritative DNS
    Description: |
      The DNS test suite validates the authoritative DNS services for the TLD
      or RSP.

      The DNS test suite is taken from the test plans that are part of the
      [Zonemaster software](https://github.com/zonemaster) (`Zonemaster::Engine`
      version v4.7.3). Test case IDs from this document can be mapped to the
      Zonemaster test IDs by removing the `dns-` prefix.

      Since Zonemaster is designed to perform testing of domain names anywhere
      in the DNS hierarchy, not all Zonemaster tests are applicable for TLDs and
      may not be listed in the test suites in this document.

      ## Testing of Anycast networks using multiple vantage points

      In order to test anycast networks without requiring RSPs to provide the
      unicast adresses of their nodes, all tests carried out over the network
      will be performed from multiple vantage points. All vantage points must
      receive the same response in order for the tests to pass.

    Test-Cases: ^dns-

  StandardDNSSEC:
    Order: 2
    Name: DNS Security Extensions (DNSSEC)
    Description: |
      The DNSSEC test suite validates the DNSSEC signing service for the TLD or
      RSP.

      The DNSSEC test suite is taken from the test plans that are part of the
      [Zonemaster software](https://github.com/zonemaster) (`Zonemaster::Engine`
      version v4.7.3). Test case IDs from this document can be mapped to the
      Zonemaster test IDs by removing the `dnssec-` prefix.

      Since Zonemaster is designed to perform testing of domain names anywhere
      in the DNS hierarchy, not all Zonemaster tests are applicable for TLDs and
      may not be listed in the test suites in this document.
    Test-Cases: ^dnssec-

  StandardRDDS:
    Order: 3
    Name: Registration Data Directory Services (RDDS)
    Description: |
      The DNSSEC test suite validates the RDDS service(s) of the TLD or RSP.

      The RDAP test suite is derived from the test specification of the [RDAP
      Conformance Tool](https://github.com/icann/rdap-conformance-tool/blob/master/doc/RDAPConformanceToolSpecifications.pdf).
      As with the DNS and DNSSEC tests, the test IDs can be mapped to the test
      IDs in this document by removing the `rdap-` prefix.

      Due to the upcoming retirement of Nicname/Whois, port-43 services are not
      tested.
    Test-Cases: ^rdap

  StandardEPP:
    Order: 4
    Name: Extensible Provisioning Protocol (EPP)
    Description: |
