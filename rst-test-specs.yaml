Preamble: |
  This file describes each test [plan](#test-plans), [suite](#test-suites) and
  [case](#test-cases) in the RST system, as well as the
  [input parameters](#input-parameters) required for each, relevant
  [resources](#resources), any inter-case dependencies, and the
  [errors](#errors) that might occur during testing.
  
  The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD",
  "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
  document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC
  2119](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc2119.html) when, and only when, they
  appear in all capitals, as shown here.
  
  # 2.1. Test plans
  
  An individual *Test Plan* addresses a particular scenario (for example, RSP
  evaluation or Pre-Delegation Testing). Each plan consists of one or more *test
  suites*, which in turn include one or more *test cases*.
  
  ## 2.1.1. Test plan types
  
  There are two types of test plan described in this document:
  
  * **Business as usual** plans, which are used as part of the lifecycle of a
  gTLD (Pre-Delegion Test, RSP/DNS RSP change Test, IDN Test, SRS Gateway
  Test)
  * **RSP evaluation** plans, which are used as part of the RSP evaluation
  program.
  
  # 2.2. Test suites
  
  A *Test Suite* is a collection of *test cases* with a common theme or subject
  matter, for example, Authoritative DNS or Registry Data Escrow.
  
  # 2.3. Test cases
  
  A *Test Case* describes a process for determining the conformance or
  acceptability of a certain element of the system.
  
  A test case consists of a *test procedure* which accepts zero or more **input
  parameters**, and generates one or more **test results**.
  
  ## 2.3.1. Input parameters
  
  All test cases require some information about the subject of the test, for
  example, service hostnames, credentials, and functional parameters. These
  *input parameters* may be shared across multiple test cases.
  
  ## 2.3.2. Test environments
  
  Each test plan indicates whether the test is to be carried out in the
  production environment, or whether a test, staging or OT&E environment may be
  used. In general, test plans which are designed for "business as usual" use
  during the lifecycle of a TLD **MUST** be carried out in the production
  registry infrastructure, while RSP evaluation tests **MAY** be carried out in
  test, staging or OT&E environments.
  
  ## 2.3.3. Test results
  
  Test cases will generate one or more *test results*. Test results indicate the
  outcome of the test and other relevant information.
  
  ## 2.3.4. General pass/fail criteria
  
  In general, for a test to pass, **all** the test cases specified in the test
  suite(s) for the test plan **MUST** pass: if *any* fail, then the test as a
  whole will fail.
  
  A test case will fail if it produces one or more [errors](#errors) with the
  `ERROR` or `CRITICAL` severities.
  
  ## 2.3.5. Error severity levels
  
  The supported severity levels are a subset of the values defined in RFC 5424.
  
  2. `WARNING` - an issue which does not prevent the test from *passing*, but
   which may benefit from further investigation.
  1. `ERROR` - an issue which prevents the test case from *passing*, but does not
   prevent the test case from *continuing*. A test case may produce multiple
   `ERROR` results.
  2. `CRITICAL` - an issue which prevents the test case from continuing any
   further. A test case will only produce a single `CRITICAL` result and it
   will always be the last result in the log.
  
  ## 2.3.6. Common errors
  
  For each test case, various errors and critical errors are defined which will
  be used to signal why that the case might have failed.
  
  In addition to these, there are a number of errors which any test case may
  produce, which are:

    Name: SRS Gateway Test
    Description: |
      An SRS Gateway service is a Shared Registry System implementation that acts
      as a proxy between a subset of Registrars and the Registry. It uses a local
      cache to speed up EPP query commands, but forwards all EPP transform
      commands to the primary registry system. TLD registries need to deploy a
      proxy setup in order to operate in certain markets worldwide.
  
      The purpose of an SRS Gateway Test is to verify that the Registry Operator’s
      proxy setup operates in accordance with the technical and operational
      criteria for EPP systems described in the gTLD Applicant Guidebook (AGB).
      Furthermore, it **MUST** keep its own database synchronized with that of the
      TLD registry.
  
      The SRS Gateway Test Change Test uses the SRS gateway test suite only.
  
      **Note on test environment:** this is a "business as usual" test, designed to test a soon-to-be or already delegated TLD. Therefore, all input parameters provided **MUST** relate to the production registry environment.

    Order: 7
    Name: Main RSP Evaluation Test
    Description: |
      The Main RSP is responsible for the creation and maintenance of domain name
      registrations in a Shared Registration System (SRS). This encompasses the
      lifecycle of a domain name registration using domain registrars and
      protocols such as the Extensible Provisioning Protocol (EPP) and adherence
      to policies regarding the use and transparency domain name registrations
      through reporting, the Registration Data Access Protocol (RDAP), and other
      mechanisms.

    Description: |
      SRS Gateway RSPs provide a proxy between a subset of Registrars and the
      Registry. It uses a local cache to speed up EPP query commands, but forwards
      all EPP transform commands to the primary registry system. TLD registries
      need to deploy a proxy setup in order to operate in certain markets
      worldwide.
  
      The [SRS Gateway test suite](#Test-Suite-StandardSRSGateway) requires access
      to a primary registry system that is logically independent of the SRS
      Gateway system, and details of the primary registry system are required as
      input parameters.
  
      RSPs wishing to offer SRS gateway services **MUST** identify such a primary
      registry system, which **MUST** be independent of the SRS gateway system,
      and **MAY** be operated by a third party.

      The DNS test suite is derived from the test plans in version
      **v2023.1.4
        ** of [Zonemaster](https://github.com/zonemaster). Test
      case IDs from this document can be mapped to the Zonemaster test IDs by
      removing the `dns-` prefix.
  
      Since Zonemaster is designed to perform testing of domain names anywhere in the DNS hierarchy, not all Zonemaster tests are applicable for TLDs and may not be listed in the test suites in this document.
  
      # Testing of Anycast networks using multiple vantage points
  
      In order to test anycast networks without requiring RSPs to provide the
      unicast adresses of their nodes, tests carried out over the network will
      be performed from multiple vantage points. All vantage points **MUST**
      receive the same response in order for the tests to pass.
  
      # Pass/fail criteria
  
      As with all other [test suites](#test-suites), for this test suite to pass **all** the listed test cases **MUST** pass: if **any** fail, then the suite as a whole will fail.
  
      Unless stated otherwise, the pass/fail criteria for the test cases in this suite are the same as those defined in the Zonemaster documentation: that is, if Zonemaster reports that a test case has an `ERROR` or `CRITICAL` result, then the corresponding test case in this suite will fail. `INFO`, `NOTICE` and `WARNING` results will not result in a failed test case. Error codes in this suite are prefixed with `ZM_` which map onto the message tags used by Zonemaster.

      7766](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc7766#section-5), section 5.
  
      This Test Case will verify if the name servers of *Child Zone* are
      reachable over UDP. The name servers tested are both those in the
      delegation of *Child Zone* and those in the NS records in the *Child
      Zone* itself.
  
      Most Zonemaster Test Cases will query the name servers in the delegation
      or the name servers appointed by the NS records in the zone for the NS
      or SOA record, or both. It is crucial that problems are reported, but
      instead of letting several Test Cases report the same problems found,
      most Test Cases assume that this test case is run. Only this Test Case
      will report problems found in the following areas over UDP:
  
      -   Name Server not responding to a query without EDNS.
      -   Name Server not including SOA record of *Child Zone* in the answer
          section in the response on a SOA query for *Child Zone*.
      -   Name Server not including NS record of *Child Zone* in the answer
          section in the response on an NS query for *Child Zone*.
      -   Name Server not setting the AA flag in a response with SOA or NS in
          answer section.
      -   Name Server responding with unexpected [RCODE
          Name](https://www.iana.org/assignments/dns-parameters/dns-parameters.xhtml#dns-parameters-6)
          (any except "NoError") on query for SOA or NS for *Child Zone*.

      The RFC ([RFC 1034](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc1034))
      predates IPv6. Since IPv4 and IPv6 work as separate networks, this test
      case has been extended to test for two name servers that resolve into
      IPv4 addresses and IPv6 addresses respectively.

      3) and [RFC 4472](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc4472)
      (section 1.3) states that a domain (zone) should be available over IPv4
      for the time being. Therefore, it is by the default level in this test
      case considered to be more problematic not being available over IPv4
      than not being available over IPv6.

      The Domain Name System defaults to using UDP for queries and answers
      with a DNS payload limit of 512 octets (bytes). Larger replies cause an

      with substantially higher overhead. EDNS0 is used to allow for larger
      UDP responses thus reducing the need for use of TCP.

      Some of the information below may not be applicable to the RST system.
  
      # Objective
  
      The DNS standards require that nameservers treat names with case
      insensitivity. That is, the names example.com and EXAMPLE.COM should
      resolve to the same IP address. However, in the response, most
      nameservers echo back the name as it appeared in the request, preserving
      the original case.
  
      Therefore, another way to add entropy to requests is to randomly vary
      the case of letters in domain names queried. This technique, also known
      as "0x20" because bit 0x20 is used to set the case of of US-ASCII
      letters, was first proposed in the [IETF internet
      draft](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/draft-vixie-dnsext-dns0x20-00)
      Use of Bit 0x20 in DNS Labels to Improve Transaction Identity. With this
      technique, the nameserver response must match not only the query name,
      but the case of every letter in the name string; for example,
      wWw.eXaMpLe.CoM or WwW.ExamPLe.COm. This may add little or no entropy to
      queries for the top-level and root domains, but it's effective for most
      hostnames.

      DNS delegations from a parent to a child are secured with DNSSEC by
      publishing one or several Delegation Signer (DS) records in the parent
      zone, along with the NS records for the delegation.
  
      For the secure delegation to work, at least one DS record must match a
      DNSKEY record in the child zone ([RFC
      4035](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc4035#section-5), section
      5). Each DS record should match a DNSKEY record in the child zone. More
      than one DS may match the same DNSKEY. The DNSKEY that the DS record
      refer to must be used to sign the DNSKEY RRset in the child zone ([RFC

      There is no clear recommendation of the exact validity periods to use
      with DNSSEC. Shorter validity than 12 hours until expiration will give a
      serious operational problem just in case of temporary network problems,
      and longer than 180 days will create wide open holes for replay attacks.

      # Objective
  
      When DNSSEC is enabled, NSEC or NSEC3 records provide a secure denial of
      existence for records not present in the zone. This test case verifies
      that correct NSEC or NSEC3 records with valid signatures are returned
      for a query for an non-existent name.
  
      Furthermore, it is verified that the name servers for the zone are
      consistent about NSEC and NSEC3, i.e. either all servers should use NSEC
      or all servers should use NSEC3. It is never permitted to serve both
      NSEC and NSEC3 for the same zone.
  
      The use of the NSEC RR type is described in [RFC

      The system will monitor the zone specified in the `dnssec.zskRolloverZone`
      input parameter. The domain may be present anywhere in the DNS hierarchy
      (that is, it does not need to be a TLD), but **MUST** have a secure chain of

      trust anchor.
  
      The zone **MUST** contain at least 10,000 delegations, where a delegation is
      considered to be one or more `NS` records with owner names that are below
      the zone's origin. If NSEC3 is used for secure denial of existence, the

      present for all `NS` rrsets, irrespective of whether a corresponding `DS`
      record is published)*.
  
      Monitoring will be carried out using `SOA` queries sent to multiple
      validating DNS resolvers, and by validating the result of a a zone transfer

      (including an update to the DS record in the parent zone), where the
      algorithm used to secure the domain is changed, without disrupting the

      Note that the specific algorithms being rolled to and from are not
      significant (although they **MUST** be present in the IANA registry); it
      is not required that the new algorithm be more "secure" than the original

      1. At least one `A` record **MUST** be published in the DNS for the EPP
         hostname, to allow IPv4-only hosts to connect to the EPP service.
      2. At least one `AAAA` record **SHOULD** be published in the DNS for the
         EPP hostname, to allow IPv6-only hosts to connect to the EPP service.
      3. EPP is associated with TCP port 700. All IPv4/IPv6 addresses published
         in the DNS for the EPP hostname **MUST** accept TCP connections on this
         port. Since the EPP specification requires IP-based access control, the
         RSP **MUST** configure their firewall to allow access from the IP
         addresses listed in the `epp.clientACL` resource.
      4. EPP uses TLS to secure the channel between client and server. All
         service ports **MUST** support TLSv1.2 and optionally any subsequent
         protocol published by the IETF.
      5. TLSv1.1 and all previous versions have known security issues and **MUST
         NOT** be supported by any service ports.
      6. To ensure that the connection can be trusted, all service ports
         **MUST** present a certificate issued by a trusted CA, such as those
         supported by major browsers.
      7. All TLS certificates **MUST NOT** have expired, and **MUST** be
         presented wth any required intermediate certificates.
      8. The EPP server name **MUST** match at least one `subjectAltName` field
         in all presented certificates (either exact match or wildcard).
      9. Service ports **MUST** use at least one of the ciphers recommended in
         RFC 9325 (or any successor document).

         namespace URIs that are appropriate. The only mandatory URI that
         **MUST** be present is the domain namespace URI. The host and contact
         namespace URIs may be required depending on the `epp.hostModel` and
         `general.minimalPublicDataSet` parameters.
      6. All `<extURI>` element(s) in the `<greeting>` **MUST** contain XML
         namespace URIs that have been registered in the IANA registry, and that
         the mandatory extensions are also included.

        contains a status code not defined in RFC 5733;
      * The server **MUST NOT** accept a `<contact:postalInfo>` element that
        contains a `type` attribute that is neither `int` nor `loc`;
      * The server **MUST NOT** accept a `<contact:cc>` element that contains a

    Description: |
      This test attempts to create a number of host objects, and validates
      the server's response. For example, the test will expect that the server
      will reject a command that creates an object with missing or invalid
      properties, but will accept a command to create an object with valid
      properties. Property values will be randomly generated but will contain
      realistic values. No personal information will be transmitted as part
      of this test.
  
      If the `epp.hostModel` input parameter is `attributes`, this test will

    Summary: domain <create> command test
    Description: |
      This test performs a series domain `<create>` commands, using pseudo-
      random ASCII domain names under each TLD in the TLD set. If the
      `general.minimalPublicDataSet` input parameter is `false`, then a contact
      object (containing pseudo-random contact information) will be created
      beforehand and used as the registrant. If the `epp.hostModel` parameter is
      `objects`, then two host objects with pseudo-random names will be created
      and used as the nameservers (otherwise the names will be provided as
      attributes).
  
      The client will perform several `<create>` commands, each of which will
      test certain aspects of the server's processing of those commands, for
      example:
  
      * to confirm that the server does not accept invalid values for object
        properties (such as domain name, registration period, registant ID,
        nameservers, and DS record parameters). Examples:
          * invalid domain
          * invalid period (1-10 years)
          * invalid host attributes (if applicable)
          * host attributes with subordinate names and missing glue (if
            applicable)
          * invalid DS/keyData record parameters (keyTag, algorithm, digest type,
            and malformed digest)
      * to confirm that the server does not accept commands which reference
        non-existent host/contact objects (if applicable)
      * to confirm that the server rejects a `<create>` command which
        specifies a registrant contact (where the
        `general.minimalPublicDataSet` input parameter is `true`)
      * to confirm that the server rejects a `<create>` command which does not
        specify a registrant contact (where the
        `general.minimalPublicDataSet`) input parameter is `false`
      * to confirm that the server rejects a `<create>` command containing
        host objects when the `epp.hostModel` parameter is `attributes`
      * to confirm that the server rejects a `<create>` command containing
        host attributes when the `epp.hostModel` parameter is `objects`
      * to confirm that the the server which implements RFC 9154 accepts a
        `<create>` command without an authInfo command.
  
      Both registrar IDs (those specified in the `epp.clid01` and `epp.clid02`
      input parameters) will be used to create domains.
  
      Once the `<create>` commands have been processed, the client will then
      perform `<info>` commands to confirm that:
  
      * the `<roid>` element is valid and contains a repository ID registered
        with IANA;
      * the `<crDate>` and `<exDate>` elements are present and valid;
      * the `<crID>` and `<clID>` elements match the client ID used to create
        the domain.
      * DNSSEC information provided in the `<create>` command is present and
        correct.

    Description: |
      This test will confirm that the client is able to perform an `<update>`
      command on the domain names created in `epp-14`, including:
  
      * adding and removing client-assigned status codes
      * adding and removing nameservers (whether objects or attributes)
      * changing registrant object (if applicable)
      * adding and remove DNSSEC information
  
      The client will also confirm that it cannot perform an `<update>` command
      on a domain sponsored by another registrar, and that the server responds
      with a `2201` authorization error.
  
      Once the `<update>` commands have been processed, the client will then
      perform `<info>` commands to confirm that the changes have been correctly
      stored by the server.

      `epp-14`.
  
      * Following a succesful `<renew>` command, the expiry date of the domain
        **MUST** have been increased by the period specified by the client;
      * The domain **MUST** have an RGP status of `renewPeriod`;
      * The server **MUST** reject a `<renew>` command if it would result in
        the expiry date being more than 10 years into the future.
  
      The client will issue the `<renew>` commands and then perform `<info>`
      commands to ensure that the expiry date and RGP status of the domain are
      set correctly.

    Summary: domain <transfer> command test
    Description: |
      This test will confirm that the client is able to initiate a domain
      transfer.
  
      The client will perform an `<update>` command to set the authInfo code for
      the test domain (taken from the set created in `epp-14`) to a
      randomly-determined value. If the server implements RFC 9154, it **MUST**
      reject the `<update>` command if the authInfo code is insufficently
      secure.
  
      Then, using a second set of credentials, the client will connect to the
      EPP server and authenticate, submit `<transfer>` commands, and validate
      the responses.
  
      This test will confirm that:
  
      * the server rejects a `<transfer>` command with an invalid authInfo code
      * the server rejects a command which would extend the domain's validity
        period more than 10 years into the future
      * the server accepts a `<transfer>` command with a valid authInfo code
        and period.
  
      The client will use an `<info>` command to ensure that the
      `pendingTransfer` status code is added to the domain after a successul
      transfer request.
  
      Once the transfer request has been accepted, the sponsoring client will
      wait for a message to be received on the server's message queue, and will
      then approve the transfer. This message **MUST** be received within 120
      seconds of the transfer request.
  
      Once the gaining registrar has also received a message on the queue, the
      client will use an `<info>` command to confirm that:
  
      * the domain is now under the sponsorship of the gaining registrar
      * the authInfo code has been reset by the server (if the server supports
        RFC 9154).
  
      This message **MUST** be received within 120 seconds of the transfer
      approval.

      commands, for example:
  
      * an `<update>` command which specifies a syntatically invalid host name
        is rejected;
      * an `<update>` command which places the object out-of-bailiwick is
        accepted;
      * an `<update>` command which places the object within a non-existent
        domain is rejected;
      * an `<update>` command which places the object within a domain sponsored
        by another registrar is rejected. The domain name(s) provided in the
        `epp.registeredNames` parameter will be used for this test.
      * an `<update>` command which places the object within a domain sponsored
        by the test client is accepted. A domain created during the `epp-14`
        test case will be used as the new parent domain.
  
      The client will then perform `<info>` commands on the objects successfully
      updated, to confirm that the server has correctly stored the updated
      values.

    Description: |
      This test is used to confirm the conformance of the EPP server's
      implementation of the Claims Check Form, as described in Section
      3.1.1 of RFC 8334.
  
      For this test, it is assumed that the EPP server has been configured to
      use data (specifically the Domain Name Label List, as described in Section
      5.3.3.1 of RFC 9361) from the TMCH test environment.
  
      The client will connect to the EPP server using the provided credentials
      and will then perform a series of `<check>` commands, using the Launch
      extension to specify a value of `claims` for the `type` attribute of the
      `<launch:check>` element and the `<launch:phase>` element. It will then
      confirm that the server returns an appropriate response:
  
      * a `<check>` response for a domain that is present on the DNL contains
        the correct `<launch:claimKey>` element;
      * a `<check>` response for a domain that is NOT present on the DNL
        does not contain a `<launch:claimKey>` element.

      This test is used to confirm the conformance of the EPP server's
      implementation of the Sunrise Create Form, as described in Section
      3.3.1 of RFC 8334.
  
      For this test, it is assumed that the EPP server has been configured to
      use data (specifically the Domain Name Label List, as described in Section
      5.3.3.1 of RFC 9361) from the TMCH test environment.
  
      The client will connect to the EPP server and will submit `<create>`
      commands, using domain names and SMD files present in the TMCH test
      environment.
  
      If the server supports Start Date sunrises, the fully-qualified domain
      name will be constructed using a label from the SMD file and the
      `minimumRPMS.sunriseTLD` input parameter. If the domain is not already
      present in the registry, the Server **MUST** respond with a `1000` or `1001`
      result code, however, if the client receives a `2302` "object exists" result
      code, it will retry with a different domain name, until a `1000` or `1001`
      response is received.
  
      If the server supports End Date sunrises, the fully-qualified domain
      name will be constructed using a label from the SMD file and the
      `minimumRPMS.sunriseTLD` input parameter. The Server **MUST** respond with
      a `1000` or `1001` result code, and create a launch application.
  
      Once the `<create>` commands have been processed, the client will then
      perform `<info>` commands to confirm that the domains or launch applications
      have been created and that the submitted object properties have been
      correctly stored.
  
      The client will also confirm that the server rejects attempts to:
  
      1. create a domain using an invalid SMD;
      2. create a domain using a revoked SMD;
      3. create a domain using an SMD signed by a revoked certificate.

      The client will connect to the EPP server and will submit `<create>`
      commands, using domain names present in the TMCH test environment.
  
      The domain name will be constructed using a label from the DNL, and the
      `minimumRPMS.claimsTLD` input parameter. The client will perform a
      Trademark Claims `<check>` command beforehand to obtain the claim key, and
      will then synthesise a trademark claims acknowledgement. The server
      **MUST** respond with a `1000` or `1001` response.
  
      Once the `<create>` commands have been processed, the client will then
      perform `<info>` commands to confirm that the domains have been created and
      that the submitted object properties have been correctly stored.
  
      The client will also confirm that the server rejects attempts to:
  
      1. create a domain using an invalid claim key;
      2. create a domain using an expired claim key;
      3. create a domain using an acceptance datetime more than 48 hours in the
