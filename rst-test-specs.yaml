Preamble: |
  The Test System consists of several *test plans*, each of which addresses a
  particular scenario. The test plans follow a structure and methodology derived
  from ISO/IEC 29119 *(formerly IEEE 829-2008)*.

  Each *test plan* includes one or more *test suites*, which in turn include
  one or more *test cases*. For a test to succeed, every test case in every
  test suite has to pass.

  This file describes each test plan, suite and case in the RST system, as well
  as the input parameters required for each.

Test-Plans:
  StandardPreDelegationTest:
    Order: 1
    Name: Pre-Delegation Test
    Description: |
      The purpose of the Pre-Delegation Test is to verify that the applicant has
      met its commitment to establish registry operations in accordance with the
      technical and operational criteria described in the gTLD Applicant
      Guidebook (AGB). Each applicant will be required to complete PDT as a
      prerequisite to delegation into the root zone.

      The Pre-Delegation Test covers all critical registry services and IDNs,
      and therefore uses all test suites.
    Test-Suites:

    Name: RSP Change Test
    Description: |
      A Registry Operator may apply to ICANN to change a Material Subcontracting
      Arrangement (MSA) and appoint a new Registry Services Provider. Before
      this change can be approved, the new RSP MUST complete Registry System
      Testing to ensure their systems comply with the technical and operational
      requirements of the Registry Agreement.

      The RSP Change Test covers all critical registry services and IDNs, and
      therefore uses all test suites.
    Test-Suites:
      - StandardDNS
      - StandardDNSSEC
      - StandardEPP

  DNSRSPChangeTest:
    Order: 3
    Name: DNS RSP Change Test
    Description: |
      A Registry Operator may apply to ICANN to change a Material Subcontracting
      Arrangement (MSA) and appoint a new provider of authoritative DNS services
      instead of or in addition to any existing provider(s).

      Before this change can be approved, the new DNS provider MUST complete
      testing to ensure their systems comply with the technical and operational
      requirements of the Registry Agreement.

      The DNS RSP Change Test uses the DNS test suite only.
    Test-Suites:
      - StandardDNS
      - StandardDNSSEC

  IDNTest:
    Order: 4
    Name: IDN Test
    Description: |
      A Registry Operator may apply to ICANN to amend its Registry Agreement
      to offer new scripts and/or languages for Internationalized Domain Names.

      The purpose of an IDN RST test is to verify that the Registry Operator’s
      registry system handles IDN registrations in accordance with the
      submitted policy statements and IDN tables.

      The IDN Test uses the IDN test suite only.
    Test-Suites:
      - StandardIDN

  SRSGatewayTest:
    Order: 5
    Name: SRS Gateway Test
    Description: |
      An SRS Gateway service is a Shared Registry System implementation that
      acts as a proxy between a subset of Registrars and the Registry. It uses
      a local cache to speed up EPP query commands, but forwards all EPP
      transform commands to the primary registry system. TLD registries need to
      deploy a proxy setup in order to operate in certain markets worldwide.

      The purpose of an SRS Gateway Test is to verify that the Registry
      Operator’s proxy setup operates in accordance with the technical and
      operational criteria for EPP systems described in the gTLD Applicant
      Guidebook (AGB). Furthermore, it MUST keep its own database synchronized
      with that of the TLD registry.

      The SRS Gateway Test Change Test uses the SRS gateway test suite only.
    Test-Suites:
      - StandardSRSGateway
      - SRSGatewayIntegrationTest

      will also be evaluated using the DNSSEC RSP Evaluation Test below.
    Test-Suites:
      - StandardDNS

  DNSSECRSPEvaluationTest:
    Order: 8
    Name: DNSSEC RSP Evaluation Test
    Description: |

      provide primary or secondary authoritative DNS services.

      RSPs wishing to offer DNSSEC services in addition to authoritative DNS
      will also be evaluated using the DNSSEC RSP Evaluation Test below.
    Test-Suites:
      - StandardDNSSEC
      - DNSSECOperations

  SRSGatewayRSPTest:
    Order: 9
    Name: SRS Gateway RSP Evaluation Test
    Description: |
      SRS Gateway RSPs provide a proxy between a subset of Registrars and the
      Registry. It uses a local cache to speed up EPP query commands, but
      forwards all EPP transform commands to the primary registry system. TLD
      registries need to deploy a proxy setup in order to operate in certain
      markets worldwide.
    Test-Suites:
      - StandardSRSGateway

Test-Suites:
  StandardDNS:
    Order: 1
    Name: Authoritative DNS Service
    Description: |
      The DNS test suite validates the authoritative DNS services for the TLD
      or RSP.

      The DNS test suite is taken from the test plans that are part of the
      [Zonemaster software](https://github.com/zonemaster) (`Zonemaster::Engine`
      version v4.7.3). Test case IDs from this document can be mapped to the
      Zonemaster test IDs by removing the `dns-` prefix.

      Since Zonemaster is designed to perform testing of domain names anywhere
      in the DNS hierarchy, not all Zonemaster tests are applicable for TLDs and
      may not be listed in the test suites in this document.

      ## Testing of Anycast networks using multiple vantage points

      In order to test anycast networks without requiring RSPs to provide the
      unicast adresses of their nodes, all tests carried out over the network
      will be performed from multiple vantage points. All vantage points MUST
      receive the same response in order for the tests to pass.
    Test-Cases: ^dns-
    Input-Parameters:
      - dns.nameservers

  StandardDNSSEC:
    Order: 2
    Name: DNS Security Extensions (DNSSEC)

      [Zonemaster software](https://github.com/zonemaster) (`Zonemaster::Engine`
      version v4.7.3). Test case IDs from this document can be mapped to the
      Zonemaster test IDs by removing the hyphen-minus.

      Since Zonemaster is designed to perform testing of domain names anywhere
      in the DNS hierarchy, not all Zonemaster tests are applicable for TLDs and
      may not be listed in the test suites in this document.
    Test-Cases: ^dnssec-

  dnssecOps01-ZSKRollover:
    Summary: ZSK rollover
    Description: |
      This test case verifies the RSP's ability to perform a ZSK rollover for a
      zone.

      The system will monitor the SOA record in the domain name specified in the
      `dnssec.zskRolloverZone` input parameter. The domain may be present
      anywhere in the DNS hierarchy (that is, it does not need to be a TLD), but
      MUST have a secure chain of trust up to the root zone, so that it can be
      validated using the root zone trust anchor.

      During the test period (currently defined as 24 hours) the operator MUST
      successfully carry out a ZSK rollover for the domain, where the Zone
      Signing Key is replaced, without disrupting the chain of trust.

      To simplify testing, applicants may wish to provision domain that is
      configured with short TTLs and a short ZSK lifetime, so that a ZSK
      rollover is guaranteed to occur within the 24 test period.
    Input-Parameters:
      - dnssecOps.zskRolloverZone
    Dependencies:
  dnssecOps02-KSKRollover:
    Summary: KSK rollover
    Description: |
      This test case verifies the RSP's ability to perform a KSK rollover for a
      zone.

      The system will monitor the SOA record in the domain name specified in the
      `dnssec.kskRolloverZone` input parameter. The domain may be present
      anywhere in the DNS hierarchy (that is, it does not need to be a TLD), but
      MUST have a secure chain of trust up to the root zone, so that it can be
      validated using the root zone trust anchor.

      During the test period (currently defined as 24 hours) the operator MUST
      successfully carry out a KSK rollover for the domain, where the Key
      Signing Key is replaced, and the DS record in the parent zone is updated,
      without disrupting the chain of trust.
    Input-Parameters:
      - dnssecOps.kskRolloverZone
    Dependencies:
  dnssecOps03-AlgorithmRollover:
    Summary: algorithm rollover
    Description: |
      This test case verifies the RSP's ability to perform an algorithm rollover
      for a zone.

      The system will monitor the SOA record in the domain name specified in the
      `dnssec.algorithmRolloverZone` input parameter. The domain may be present
      anywhere in the DNS hierarchy (that is, it does not need to be a TLD), but
      MUST have a secure chain of trust up to the root zone, so that it can be
      validated using the root zone trust anchor.

      During the test period (currently defined as 72 hours) the operator MUST
      successfully carry out an algorithm rollover for the domain, where the
      algorithm used to secure the domain is changed, without disrupting the
      chain of trust.

          input parameter is `true`
        * to confirm that the server rejects a `<create>` command which does not
          specify a contact object (where the `general.minimalPublicDataSet`)
          input parameter is `false`
        * to confirm that the server rejects a `<create>` command containing
          host objects when the `epp.hostModel` parameter is `attributes`
        * to confirm that the server rejects a `<create>` command containing
          host attributes when the `epp.hostModel` parameter is `objects`

    Description: |
      This test will confirm that the client is able to initiate a domain
      transfer.

      The client will perform an `<update>` command to set the authInfo code for
      the test domain (taken from the set created in `epp-32`) to a
      randomly-determined value.

      Then, using a second set of credentials, the client will connect to the
      EPP server and authenticate, submit `<transfer>` commands, and validate
      the responses.

      This test will confirm that:

      * the server rejects a `<transfer>` command with an invalid authInfo code
      * the server rejects a command which would extend the domain's validity
        period more than 10 years into the future
      * the server accepts a `<transfer>` command with a valid authInfo code
        and period.

      Once the transfer request has been accepted, the sponsoring client will
      wait for a message to be received on the server's message queue, and will
      then approve the transfer.

      Once the gaining registrar has also received a message on the queue, the
      client will confirm that:

      * the domain is now under the sponsorship of the gaining registrar
      * the authInfo code has been reset by the server (if the server supports
        RFC9154).

      This test is used to confirm the conformance of the EPP server's
      implementation of the Trademark Check Form, as described in Section
      3.1.3 of RFC8334.

      For this test, it is assumed that the EPP server has been configured to
      use data (specifically the Domain Name Label List, as described in Section
      5.3.3.1 of RFC9361) from the TMCH test environment.

      The client will connect to the EPP server using the provided credentials
      and will then perform a series of `<check>` commands, using the Launch
      extension to specify a value of `trademark` for the `type` attribute of
      the `<launch:check>` element. It will then confirm that the server returns
      an appropriate response:

      * a `<check>` response for a domain that is present on the DNL contains
        the correct `<launch:claimKey>` element;
      * a `<check>` response for a domain that is NOT present on the DNL
        does not contain a `<launch:claimKey>` element.

      3.3.1 of RFC8334.

      For this test, it is assumed that the EPP server has been configured to
      use data (specifically the Domain Name Label List, as described in Section
      5.3.3.1 of RFC9361) from the TMCH test environment.

      The client will connect to the EPP server and will submit `<create>`
      commands, using domain names and SMD files present in the TMCH test
      environment.

      If the server supports Start Date sunrises, the fully-qualified domain
      name will be constructed using a label from the SMD file and the
      `zz--edsct` TLD (eg `example.zz-edsct`). The Server MUST respond with a
      1000 or 1001 result code, however, if the client receives a 2302 "object
      exists" result code, it will retry with a different domain name.

      The client will also attempt to create a domain using an invalid SMD,
      which the server MUST reject.

      If the server supports End Date sunrises, the fully-qualified domain
      name will be constructed using a label from the SMD file and the
      `zz-sdsct` TLD (eg `example.zz-sdsct`). The Server MUST respond with a
      1000 or 1001 result code.

      The client will also attempt to create a domain using an invalid SMD,
      which the server MUST reject.

    Summary: Level 2 variant handling test
    Description: |
      This test confirms the EPP server's conformance with the Level 2 variant
      support (variants are supported within the same TLD).

      If there are no IDN tables for which Level 2 support is claimed, this
      test will be skipped.

      For each supported IDN table, the test client will perform a series of
      `<create>` commands using a pre-defined catalogue of test labels. If
      required, the client will create any contact object(s) needed.

      The client will then submit `<create>` commands for one or more labels
      that are variants of the names created in the first step. Some of these
      commands will be made using the same registrar account as the first step,
      while some will be made using alternate credentials. If the value of the
      `general.minimalPublicDataSet` input parameter is `false`, then some
      commands will also use a different registrant contact.

      The server MUST reject `<create>` commands where the (a) registrar is
      different from that of the primary label or (b) the registrant (if
      applicable) is different.
    Input-Parameters:
      - epp.hostName
      - epp.clid
      - epp.pwd

    Summary: Level 3 variant handling test
    Description: |
      This test confirms the EPP server's conformance with the Level 3 variant
      support (variants are supported within variant TLD(s)).

      If there are no IDN tables for which Level 3 support is claimed, this
      test will be skipped.

      For each supported IDN table, the test client will perform a series of
      `<create>` commands using a pre-defined catalogue of test labels. If
      required, the client will create any contact object(s) needed.

      The client will then submit `<create>` commands for one or more labels
      that are variants (at both second- and top-level) of the names created in
      the first step. Some of these commands will be made using the same
      registrar account as the first step, while some will be made using
      alternate credentials. If the value of the `general.minimalPublicDataSet`
      input parameter is `false`, then some commands will also use a different
      registrant contact.

      The server MUST reject `<create>` commands where the (a) registrar is
      different from that of the primary label or (b) the registrant (if
      applicable) is different.
