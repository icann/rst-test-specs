Preamble: |
  This file describes each test [plan](#test-plans), [suite](#test-suites) and
  [case](#test-cases) in the RST system, as well as the
  [input parameters](#input-parameters) required for each, relevant
  [resources](#resources), any inter-case dependencies, and the
  [errors](#errors) that might occur during testing.
  
  The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD",
  "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
  document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC
  2119](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc2119.html) when, and only when, they
  appear in all capitals, as shown here.
  
  # 2.1. Test plans
  
  An individual *Test Plan* addresses a particular scenario (for example, RSP
  evaluation or Pre-Delegation Testing). Each plan consists of one or more *test
  suites*, which in turn include one or more *test cases*.
  
  ## 2.1.1. Test plan types
  
  There are two types of test plan described in this document:
  
  * **Business as usual** plans, which are used as part of the lifecycle of a
  gTLD (Pre-Delegion Test, RSP/DNS RSP change Test, IDN Test, SRS Gateway
  Test)
  * **RSP evaluation** plans, which are used as part of the RSP evaluation
  program.
  
  # 2.2. Test suites
  
  A *Test Suite* is a collection of *test cases* with a common theme or subject
  matter, for example, Authoritative DNS or Registry Data Escrow.
  
  # 2.3. Test cases
  
  A *Test Case* describes a process for determining the conformance or
  acceptability of a certain element of the system.
  
  A test case consists of a *test procedure* which accepts zero or more **input
  parameters**, and generates one or more **test results**.
  
  ## 2.3.1. Input parameters
  
  All test cases require some information about the subject of the test, for
  example, service hostnames, credentials, and functional parameters. These
  *input parameters* may be shared across multiple test cases.
  
  ## 2.3.2. Test environments
  
  Each test plan indicates whether the test is to be carried out in the
  production environment, or whether a test, staging or OT&E environment may be
  used. In general, test plans which are designed for "business as usual" use
  during the lifecycle of a TLD **MUST** be carried out in the production
  registry infrastructure, while RSP evaluation tests **MAY** be carried out in
  test, staging or OT&E environments.
  
  ## 2.3.3. Test results
  
  Test cases will generate one or more *test results*. Test results indicate the
  outcome of the test and other relevant information.
  
  ## 2.3.4. General pass/fail criteria
  
  In general, for a test to pass, **all** the test cases specified in the test
  suite(s) for the test plan **MUST** pass: if *any* fail, then the test as a
  whole will fail.
  
  A test case will fail if it produces one or more [errors](#errors) with the
  `ERROR` or `CRITICAL` severities.
  
  ## 2.3.5. Error severity levels
  
  1. `INFO` - an informational message.
  1. `NOTICE` - a normal but significant condition.
  2. `WARNING` - an issue which does not prevent the test from *passing*, but
   which may benefit from further investigation.
  1. `ERROR` - an issue which prevents the test from *passing*, but does not
   prevent the test from *continuing*. A test may produce multiple `ERROR`
   results.
  2. `CRITICAL` - an issue which prevents the test from continuing any
   further. A test will only produce a single `CRITICAL` result and it
   will always be the last result in the log.
  
  ## 2.3.6. Common errors
  
  For each test case, various errors and critical errors are defined which will
  be used to signal why that the case might have failed.
  
  In addition to these, there are a number of errors which any test case may
  produce, which are:

    Name: SRS Gateway Test
    Description: |
      An SRS Gateway service is a Shared Registry System implementation that
      acts as a proxy between a subset of Registrars and the Registry. It uses
      a local cache to speed up EPP query commands, but forwards all EPP
      transform commands to the primary registry system. TLD registries need to
      deploy a proxy setup in order to operate in certain markets worldwide.
  
      The purpose of an SRS Gateway Test is to verify that the Registry
      Operator’s proxy setup operates in accordance with the technical and
      operational criteria for EPP systems described in the gTLD Applicant
      Guidebook (AGB). Furthermore, it **MUST** keep its own database
      synchronized with that of the TLD registry.
  
      The SRS Gateway Test Change Test uses the SRS gateway test suite only.
  
      **Note on test environment:** this is a "business as usual" test, designed to test a soon-to-be or already delegated TLD. Therefore, all input parameters provided **MUST** relate to the production registry environment.

    Order: 7
    Name: Main RSP Evaluation Test
    Description: |
      The Main RSP is responsible for the creation and maintenance of domain
      name registrations in a Shared Registration System (SRS). This encompasses
      the lifecycle of a domain name registration using domain registrars and
      protocols such as the Extensible Provisioning Protocol (EPP) and adherence
      to policies regarding the use and transparency domain name registrations
      through reporting, the Registration Data Access Protocol (RDAP), and other
      mechanisms.

    Description: |
      SRS Gateway RSPs provide a proxy between a subset of Registrars and the
      Registry. It uses a local cache to speed up EPP query commands, but
      forwards all EPP transform commands to the primary registry system. TLD
      registries need to deploy a proxy setup in order to operate in certain
      markets worldwide.
  
      The [SRS Gateway test suite](#Test-Suite-StandardSRSGateway) requires
      access to a primary registry system that is logically independent of the
      SRS Gateway system, and details of the primary registry system are
      required as input parameters. RSPs wishing to offer SRS gateway services
      **MUST** identify such a primary registry system, which **MUST** be
      independent of the SRS gateway system, and MAY be operated by a third
      party.

      # Testing of Anycast networks using multiple vantage points
  
      In order to test anycast networks without requiring RSPs to provide the
      unicast adresses of their nodes, tests carried out over the network will
      be performed from multiple vantage points. All vantage points **MUST**
      receive the same response in order for the tests to pass.
  
      # Pass/fail criteria
  
      As with all other [test suites](#test-suites), for this test suite to pass **all** the listed test cases **MUST** pass: if **any** fail, then the suite as a whole will fail.
  
      Unless stated otherwise, the pass/fail criteria for the test cases in this suite are the same as those defined in the Zonemaster documentation: that is, if Zonemaster reports that a test case has an `ERROR` or `CRITICAL` result, then the corresponding test case in this suite will fail. `INFO`, `NOTICE` and `WARNING` results will not result in a failed test case. Error codes in this suite are prefixed with `ZM_` which map onto the message tags used by Zonemaster.

      # Objective
  
      In order for the domain and its resources to be accessible,
      authoritative name servers must have addresses in the routable public
      addressing space.
  
      IANA is responsible for global coordination of the IP addressing system.
      Aside its address allocation activities, it maintains reserved address
      ranges for special uses. These ranges can be categorized into three
      types : [Special purpose IPv4
      addresses](https://www.iana.org/assignments/iana-ipv4-special-registry/iana-ipv4-special-registry.xml),
      [Special purpose IPv6
      addresses](https://www.iana.org/assignments/iana-ipv6-special-registry/iana-ipv6-special-registry.xml)
      and [Multicast reserved
      addresses](https://www.iana.org/assignments/multicast-addresses/multicast-addresses.xml).
  
      # Pass/fail criteria
  
      If one name server has one of its addresses matches a forbidden address
      block, the test fails. If all the name server addresses are outside
      these forbidden blocks, the test case succeeds.
    Errors:
    - ZM_DNS_ADDRESS01_FAILED

      # Objective
  
      Some anti-spam techniques use reverse DNS lookup to allow incoming
      traffic. In order to prevent name servers to be blocked or blacklisted,
      DNS administrators should publish PTR records associated to name server
      addresses.
  
      \[technical reference to be found\]
  
      # Pass/fail criteria
  
      If the test case succeeds, its result is a list of addresses with
      corresponding hostnames which are the result of the PTR queries
      performed. The result could be represented as a hash table where the
      keys are the IP addresses and the values their corresponding hostnames.

      traffic. In order to prevent name servers to be blocked or blacklisted,
      DNS administrators should publish PTR records associated with the name
      server addresses.
  
      Moreover, as mentioned in paragraph 2.1 of [RFC
      1912](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc1912) when a PTR record
      exists, it must match the host name.
  
      # Pass/fail criteria
  
      Multiple addresses and multiple PTR records are allowed. The test
      succeeds if every name server address has one or more PTR records and
      one of these records matches the server name. If one address doesn't
      match, the whole test case fails.

      over UDP. The name servers tested are both those in the\ndelegation of *Child
      Zone* and those in the NS records in the *Child\nZone* itself.\n\nMost Zonemaster
      Test Cases will query the name servers in the delegation\nor the name servers
      appointed by the NS records in the zone for the NS\nor SOA record, or both. It
      is crucial that problems are reported, but\ninstead of letting several Test Cases
      report the same problems found,\nmost Test Cases assume that this test case is
      run. Only this Test Case\nwill report problems found in the following areas over
      UDP:\n\n-   Name Server not responding to a query without EDNS.\n-   Name Server
      not including SOA record of *Child Zone* in the answer\n    section in the response
      on a SOA query for *Child Zone*.\n-   Name Server not including NS record of *Child

      Test Case will verify if the name servers of *Child Zone* are\nreachable over
      TCP. The name servers tested are both those in the\ndelegation of *Child Zone*
      and those in the NS records in the *Child\nZone* itself.\n\nThis Test Case will

      # Objective
  
      The objective in this test is to verify that all IP addresses of the
      domain's authoritative name servers are announced from different ASNs
      (autonomous system number). See [RFC
      1930](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc1930) and
      [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autonomous_system_(Internet))
      for an explanation of AS (autonomous system).
  
      This test is done separately on IPv4 and IPv6, and both must match the
      criterion.
  
      [RFC 2182](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc2182#section-3.1),
      section 3.1, clearly specifies that distinct authoritative name servers
      for a child domain should be placed in different topological and
      geographical locations. The objective is to minimise the likelihood of a
      single failure disabling all of them.
  
      # Pass/fail criteria
  
      The outcome of this Test Case is "fail" if there is at least one message
      with the severity level ERROR or CRITICAL.
  
      The outcome of this Test Case is "warning" if there is at least one
      message with the severity level WARNING, but no message with severity
      level ERROR or CRITICAL.
  
      In other cases the outcome of this Test Case is "pass".

      # Objective
  
      For the data served by the authoritative name servers for a designated
      zone to be consistent, all authoritative name servers must serve the
      same SOA record for the designated zone.
  
      If the serial number (explained in 3.3.13. of [RFC
      1035](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc1035)), which is part of
      the SOA record, is not consistent between authoritative servers, there
      is a possibility that the data served is inconsistent. The reasons for
      this inconsistency may be different - such as misconfiguration, or as a
      result of slow propagation to the secondary name servers.
  
      The objective of this test is to verify that the serial number is
      consistent between different authoritative name servers.
  
      For reference purposes : [RFC
      1982](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc1982) explains the serial
      number arithmetic, and section 4.3.5 of [RFC
      1034](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc1035) explains the
      importance of serial number consistency.

      # Objective
  
      Section 4.1 of [RFC 1034](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc1034)
      specifies that there must be a minimum of two name servers for a domain.
      This test is done to verify this condition.
  
      The RFC ([RFC 1034](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc1034))
      predates IPv6. Since IPv4 and IPv6 work as separate networks, this test
      case has been extended to test for two name servers that resolve into
      IPv4 addresses and IPv6 addresses respectively.
  
      Both [RFC 3901](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc3901) (section
      3) and [RFC 4472](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc4472)
      (section 1.3) states that a domain (zone) should be available over IPv4
      for the time being. Therefore, it is by the default level in this test
      case considered to be more problematic not being available over IPv4
      than not being available over IPv6.

      # Objective
  
      The Domain Name System defaults to using UDP for queries and answers
      with a DNS payload limit of 512 octets (bytes). Larger replies cause an
      initial truncation indication leading to a subsequent handling via TCP
      with substantially higher overhead. EDNS0 is used to allow for larger
      UDP responses thus reducing the need for use of TCP.
  
      But [IANA](https://www.iana.org/help/nameserver-requirements) still
      maintains that referrals from the parent zone name servers must fit into

      # Objective
  
      Name servers for a zone are defined in NS records. An NS record points
      at a name, i.e. the RDATA for an NS record is a domain name. That name
      is the name of the name server. [RFC
      2181](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc2181#section-10.3),
      section 10.3, states that the name of the name server must not itself
      point at a CNAME.
  
      The objective of this test is to verify that name servers of the tested
      domain (zone) do not point at CNAME records.
  
      # Pass/fail criteria

      # Objective
  
      To ensure consistency in DNS, an authoritative name server should not be
      configured to do recursive lookups. Also, open recursive resolvers are
      considered bad internet practice due to their capability of assisting in
      large scale DDoS attacks. The introduction to [RFC
      5358](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc5358) elaborates on
      mixing recursor and authoritative functionality, and the issue is
      further elaborated by [D.J.
      Bernstein](https://cr.yp.to/djbdns/separation.html).
  
      Section 2.5 of [RFC 2870](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc2870)
      have very specific requirement on disabling recursion functionality on
      root name servers.

      # Objective
  
      EDNS(0) is a mechanism to announce capabilities of a DNS implementation,
      and is now basically required by any new functionality in DNS such as
      DNSSEC. EDNS(0) is standardized in [RFC
      6891](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6891).
  
      This test case checks that all name servers has the capability to do
      EDNS(0) or if not, correctly replies to queries containing EDNS (OPT
      record).
  
      Servers not supporting EDNS(0) must return FORMERR ([RFC 6891, section
      7](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6891#section-7)):
  
      > Responders that choose not to implement the protocol extensions
      > defined in this document MUST respond with a return code (RCODE) of
      > FORMERR to messages containing an OPT record in the additional section
      > and MUST NOT include an OPT record in the response.
  
      Servers supporting EDNS(0) must reply with EDNS(0) ([RFC 6891, section
      6.1.1](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6891#section-6.1.1)):
  
      > If an OPT record is present in a received request, compliant
      > responders MUST include an OPT record in their respective responses.
  
      To eliminating the risk of falsely classifying the server as not
      supporting EDNS due e.g. firewall issues, the UDP buffer size is set to
      512 bytes (octets).

      # Objective
  
      All name servers names listed for a delegation must be resolvable in
      DNS. If they are not resolvable using DNS this is a sign of

      It could also lower the performance for any resolver trying to resolve
      the name.
  
      The objective of this test is to resolve the domain using all the listed

      <https://github.com/zonemaster/zonemaster/blob/v2023.1.4/docs/public/specifications/tests/Nameserver-TP/nameserver08.md>.
  
      # Objective
  
      The DNS standards require that nameservers treat names with case
      insensitivity. That is, the names example.com and EXAMPLE.COM should
      resolve to the same IP address. However, in the response, most
      nameservers echo back the name as it appeared in the request, preserving
      the original case.
  
      Therefore, another way to add entropy to requests is to randomly vary
      the case of letters in domain names queried. This technique, also known
      as "0x20" because bit 0x20 is used to set the case of of US-ASCII
      letters, was first proposed in the [IETF internet
      draft](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/draft-vixie-dnsext-dns0x20-00)
      Use of Bit 0x20 in DNS Labels to Improve Transaction Identity. With this
      technique, the nameserver response must match not only the query name,
      but the case of every letter in the name string; for example,
      wWw.eXaMpLe.CoM or WwW.ExamPLe.COm. This may add little or no entropy to
      queries for the top-level and root domains, but it's effective for most
      hostnames.

      There has been cases where the nameservers respond with complete

      results for equivalent names with different cases in the request
      (typically NXDOMAIN).

      This test case comes from version v2023.1.4 of Zonemaster. For more

      # Objective
  
      EDNS is a mechanism to announce capabilities of a DNS implementation,
      and is now basically required by any new functionality in DNS such as
      DNSSEC ([RFC 6891](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6891)).
  
      [RFC 6891](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6891#section-6.1.2),
      section 6.1.2, states that any OPTION-CODE values not understood by a
      responder or requestor MUST be ignored. Unknown OPTION-CODE values must
      be processed as though the OPTION-CODE was not even there.
  
      In this test case, we will query with an unknown EDNS OPTION-CODE and
      expect that the OPTION-CODE is not present in the response for the
      query.

      includes an OPT pseudo record.
  
      This Test Case will try to verify that if the response to a query with

      record.
  
      To trigger a truncated response, the OPT pseudo record 'DO' bit is set

      This test case comes from version v2023.1.4 of Zonemaster. For more
      information, see
      <https://github.com/zonemaster/zonemaster/blob/v2023.1.4/docs/public/specifications/tests/Zone-TP/zone01.md>.
  
      # Objective
  
      The MNAME field from the SOA record of a zone is supposed to contain the
      master name server for that zone. The hostname of the MNAME field may
      not be listed in the NS records in the zone among the delegated name
      servers, but should still be authoritative for the zone. MNAME may be
      used for other services such as DNS NOTIFY described in
      [RFC1996](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc1996#section-2).
  
      [RFC1035](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc1035#section-3.3.13),
      section 3.3.13, specifies that "the *domain-name* of the name server
      that was the original or primary source of data for this zone".
  
      [RFC1996](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc1996#section-2),
      section 2, and
      [RFC2136](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc2136#section-1),
      section 1, add that "the primary master is named in the zone's SOA MNAME
      field and optionally by an NS RR. There is by definition only one
      primary master server per zone".
  
      [RFC2181](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc2181#section-7.3),
      section 7.2, clarifies that "it is quite clear in the specifications,
      yet seems to have been widely ignored, that the MNAME field of the SOA
      record should contain the name of the primary (master) server for the
      zone identified by the SOA. It should not contain the name of the zone
      itself. That information would be useless, as to discover it, one needs
      to start with the domain name of the SOA record - that is the name of
      the zone".
  
      There exists an unstandardized practice to set the SOA MNAME to ".",
      which should not be interpreted that there is no primary master server,
      but to indicate that there is no default server for dynamic updates.
      With ".", SOA MNAME has no server name. There is at least one old and
      expired Internet-Draft that attempted to standardize that behavior,
      [draft-jabley-dnsop-missing-mname](https://www.ietf.org/archive/id/draft-jabley-dnsop-missing-mname-00.html).
      If the SOA MNAME is an empty name (".") this Test Case will not try to
      connect to a server behind it since there will never be a server behind
      that name, as the purpose is most definitely to follow that practice.
      Instead, a special message will be outputted.
  
      This Test Case will check that: - the SOA MNAME contains the master name
      server of *Child Zone*, as best as it can be determined. - the SOA MNAME
      name server is authoritative of *Child Zone*. - the SOA SERIAL of the
      SOA MNAME is at least equal to the ones found from the name servers in
      the NS record set of *Child Zone*. This comparison must be done
      following [RFC1982](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc1982). -
      the SOA MNAME name server is listed as part of the NS record set of
      *Child Zone*.

      The SOA refresh value is the number of seconds that describes how often
      a secondary name server will poll the primary name server to see if
      there is any updates. The SOA refresh value is described in section
      3.3.13 in [RFC 1035](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc1035), and
      clarified in section 2.2 of [RFC
      1912](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc1912). Setting the
      refresh value low will increase the DNS traffic between the servers, and

    Description: |
      This test case comes from version v2023.1.4 of Zonemaster. For more
      information, see
      <https://github.com/zonemaster/zonemaster/blob/v2023.1.4/docs/public/specifications/tests/Zone-TP/zone06.md>.
  
      # Objective
  
      The SOA minimum field sets the default TTL for all records in a zone.
      The recommended value is to be "cache-friendly". However, for a zone
      that changes content often, there is a need to keep the TTL values
      shorter. The use of the SOA minimum value today is the negative cache
      (where a resolver find content is missing).
  
      The SOA minimum field is described in section 3.3.13 in [RFC
      1035](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc1035), and clarified in
      section 2.2 of [RFC
      1912](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc1912). The description of
      the implementation of negative caching is in [RFC
      2308](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc2308) (although it has
      been updated by several DNSSEC related RFCs, it is still relevant for
      this purpose).
  
      The [RIPE-203](https://www.ripe.net/publications/docs/ripe-203)
      recommendation for the minimum value 2 days, but the negative caching is
      now the norm. DNSCheck has a recommended value of between 300 seconds (5
      minutes) and 86400 seconds (1 day).
  
      # Pass/fail criteria
  
      If the minimum value is larger than 86400 seconds or if the minimum
      value is lower than 300 seconds, this test case fails.

      # Objective
  
      The SOA record is crucial for the DNS zone and "exactly one SOA RR
      should be present at the top of the zone" ([RFC
      1035](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc1035#section-5.2),
      section 5.2). This test case will verify that the zone of the domain to
      be tested return exactly one SOA record.
  
      # Pass/fail criteria
  
      The outcome of this Test Case is "fail" if there is at least one message
      with the severity level *ERROR* or *CRITICAL*.
  
      The outcome of this Test Case is "warning" if there is at least one
      message with the severity level *WARNING*, but no message with severity
      level *ERROR* or *CRITICAL*.
  
      In other cases the outcome of this Test Case is "pass".

      # Objective
  
      DNS delegations from a parent to a child are secured with DNSSEC by
      publishing one or several Delegation Signer (DS) records in the parent
      zone, along with the NS records for the delegation.
  
      For the secure delegation to work, at least one DS record must match a
      DNSKEY record in the child zone ([RFC
      4035](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc4035#section-5), section
      5). Each DS record should match a DNSKEY record in the child zone. More
      than one DS may match the same DNSKEY. The DNSKEY that the DS record
      refer to must be used to sign the DNSKEY RRset in the child zone ([RFC
      4035](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc4035#section-5), section
      5).
  
      The DNSKEY record that the DS record refer to must have bit 7 ("Zone Key
      flag") set in the DNSKEY RR Flags ([RFC
      4034](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc4034#section-5.2),
      section 5.2).
  
      Bit 15 ("Secure Entry Point flag") on a DNSKEY record signals that it is
      meant to be a KSK and pointed out by a DS record. It is noted if the
      DNSKEY record that the DS points at does not have that flag set ([RFC
      4034](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc4034#section-2.1.1),
      section 2.1.1).
  
      # Summary
  
      -   Both DS record and DNSKEY record must be found, or else no further
          investigation will be done and no messages will be outputted.
      -   No messages will be outputted due to errors in the responses from
          the parent name servers.

      For an authoritative name server an increased number of NSEC3 iterations

      Section 10.3 in [RFC
      5155](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc5155#section-10.3) sets a
      maximum number of iterations depending on the DNSSEC key size -
      regardless of which algorithm is used.
  
      > A zone owner MUST NOT use a value higher than shown in the table below
      > for iterations for the given key size. A resolver MAY treat a response
      > with a higher value as insecure, after the validator has verified that

      Section 5.3.2 in [RFC

      # Pass/fail criteria
  
      If the NSEC3 iterations value is higher than 100, this test case gives a
      warning. If it is higher than the number recommended for the
      corresponding key size, this test case fails.

      # Objective
  
      Having RRSIG signature lifetimes last for too long opens up for DNS
      replay attacks. Having too short RRSIG signature lifetimes is likely to
      have a major operational impact if the master name server is down for
      that long.
  
      There is no clear recommendation of the exact validity periods to use
      with DNSSEC. Shorter validity than 12 hours until expiration will give a
      serious operational problem just in case of temporary network problems,
      and longer than 180 days will create wide open holes for replay attacks.
  
      The considerations are described in
      [RFC6781](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6781).
  
      # Pass/fail criteria
  
      If any of the signature expirations time is either shorter than 12 hours

      # Objective
  
      The DNSKEYs based on RSA have different minimum and maximum key sizes,
      which must be followed. This test case will validate the keys size of
      such keys. RSA based algorithms that are deprecated or else not suitable
      for DNSKEY ([RFC
      8624](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8624.html#section-3.1) and [IANA
      registry](https://www.iana.org/assignments/dns-sec-alg-numbers/dns-sec-alg-numbers.xml))
      are just ignored. See test case [DNSSEC05](./dnssec05.md) for test of
      algorithm.
  
      The table 1 below specify the maximum and minimum key size,
      respectively. Algorithm number can be found in [IANA
      registry](https://www.iana.org/assignments/dns-sec-alg-numbers/dns-sec-alg-numbers.xml).

      It is also recommended that an RSA based algorithm has a key length of
      at least 2048 bit as stated in [NIST SP 800-57 Part 1
      Rev. 4](https://csrc.nist.gov/publications/detail/sp/800-57-part-1/rev-4/archive/2016-01-28),

      5.6.2.
  
      This test case verifies that RSA DNSKEYs follows the stated key lengths
      from the RFCs and also the NIST recommended shortest key length.
  
      # Pass/fail criteria
  
      The outcome of this Test Case is "fail" if there is at least one message
      with the severity level *ERROR* or *CRITICAL*.

      # Objective
  
      CDS and CDNSKEY record types are defined in [RFC
      7344](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7344) and [RFC
      8078](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc8078). Both record types
      are optional in a zone. The objective of this test case is to verify
      that they are correctly set-up, if included in the zone.
  
      If a CDS record is included in the zone, the corresponding CDNSKEY
      record should also be included ([RFC
      7344](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7344#section-4), section
      4).
  
      The CDS and CDNSKEY RRsets should be consistent between all name servers
      for the zone in question.
  
      If there are both CDS RRs and CDNSKEY RRs in the zone they must match in
      content ([RFC
      7344](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7344#section-4), section
      4). It means that both must be derived from the same DNSKEY or both
      being "delete" CDS and CDNSKEY.

    Description: |
      This test case comes from version v2023.1.4 of Zonemaster. For more
      information, see
      <https://github.com/zonemaster/zonemaster/blob/v2023.1.4/docs/public/specifications/tests/DNSSEC-TP/dnssec18.md>.
  
      # Objective
  
      CDS and CDNSKEY record types are defined in [RFC
      7344](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7344) and [RFC
      8078](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc8078). Both record types
      are optional in a zone. The objective of this test case is to verify
      that there is a correct chain of trust from DS, in the parent zone to
      the CDS and CDNSKEY RRsets ([RFC
      7344](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7344#section-4.1),
      section 4.1).
  
      As stated in [RFC
      4035](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc4035#section-2.4),
      section 2.4: \> A DS RR SHOULD point to a DNSKEY RR that is present in
      the child's \> apex DNSKEY RRset, and the child's apex DNSKEY RRset
      SHOULD be \> signed by the corresponding private key."
  
      This Test case is only relevant if \* The *Child Zone* has either CDS or
      CDNSKEY record or both, and \* The parent zone has a DS RRset for the
      *Child Zone*.
  
      # Summary
  
      -   If no CDS or CDNSKEY records are found, this test case is not run
          and no message will be outputted.
      -   If no DS records are found at parent, this test case is not run and
          no message will be outputted.

  dnssecOps01-ZSKRollover:
    Summary: ZSK rollover
    Description: |
      This test case verifies the RSP's ability to perform a ZSK rollover (as
      described in [Section 4.1.1 of
      RFC 6781](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6781#section-4.1.1) for
      a zone.
  
      If the value of the `dnssecOps.csk` input parameter is `true`, then this
      test will be skipped.
  
      The system will monitor the SOA record in the domain name specified in the
      `dnssec.zskRolloverZone` input parameter. The domain may be present
      anywhere in the DNS hierarchy (that is, it does not need to be a TLD), but
      **MUST** have a secure chain of trust up to the root zone, so that it can
      be validated using the root zone trust anchor.
  
      During the test period (currently defined as 24 hours) the operator
      **MUST** successfully carry out a ZSK rollover for the domain, where the
      Zone Signing Key is replaced, without disrupting the chain of trust.
  
      To simplify testing, applicants may wish to provision domain that is
      configured with short TTLs and a short ZSK lifetime, so that a ZSK
      rollover is guaranteed to occur within the 24 test period.
    Input-Parameters:
      - dnssecOps.csk
      - dnssecOps.zskRolloverZone
    Dependencies:
  dnssecOps02-KSKRollover:
    Summary: KSK rollover
    Description: |
      This test case verifies the RSP's ability to perform a CSK/KSK rollover
      (as described in [Sections 4.1.2 and 4.13 of
      RFC 6781](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6781#section-4.1.2) for
      a zone.
  
      The system will monitor the SOA record in the domain name specified in the
      `dnssec.kskRolloverZone` input parameter. The domain may be present
      anywhere in the DNS hierarchy (that is, it does not need to be a TLD), but
      **MUST** have a secure chain of trust up to the root zone, so that it can
      be validated using the root zone trust anchor.
  
      During the test period (currently defined as 24 hours) the operator
      **MUST** successfully carry out a KSK rollover for the domain, where the
      Key Signing Key is replaced, and the DS record in the parent zone is
      updated, without disrupting the chain of trust.
    Input-Parameters:
      - dnssecOps.kskRolloverZone
    Dependencies:
  dnssecOps03-AlgorithmRollover:
    Summary: algorithm rollover
    Description: |
      This test case verifies the RSP's ability to perform an algorithm rollover
      (as described in [Section 4.1.4 of
      RFC 6781](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6781#section-4.1.2) for
      a zone.
  
      The system will monitor the SOA record in the domain name specified in the
      `dnssec.algorithmRolloverZone` input parameter. The domain may be present
      anywhere in the DNS hierarchy (that is, it does not need to be a TLD), but
      **MUST** have a secure chain of trust up to the root zone, so that it can
      be validated using the root zone trust anchor.
  
      During the test period (currently defined as 72 hours) the operator
      **MUST** successfully carry out an algorithm rollover for the domain
      (including an update to the DS record in the parent zone), where the
      algorithm used to secure the domain is changed, without disrupting the
      chain of trust.
  
      Note that the specific algorithms being rolled to and from are not
      significant (although they **MUST** be present in the IANA registry); it
      is not required that the new algorithm be more "secure" than the original
      algorithm; only that they are different. So a rollover from algorithm 13
      (`ECDSAP256SHA256`) to algorithm 8 (`RSASHA256`) will be accepted as well
      as a rollover from `RSASHA256` to `ECDSAP256SHA256`.

    Summary: Service connectivity test
    Description: |
      This test confirms that the EPP service is reachable from the probe
      servers.
  
      1. At least one `A` record **MUST** be published in the DNS for the EPP
         hostname, to allow IPv4-only hosts to connect to the EPP service.
      2. At least one `AAAA` record **SHOULD** be published in the DNS for the
         EPP hostname, to allow IPv6-only hosts to connect to the EPP service.
      3. EPP is associated with TCP port 700. All IPv4/IPv6 addresses published
         in the DNS for the EPP hostname **MUST** accept TCP connections on this
         port. Since the EPP specification requires IP-based access control, the
         RSP **MUST** configure their firewall to allow access from the IP
         addresses listed in the `epp.clientACL` resource.
      4. EPP uses TLS to secure the channel between client and server. All
         service ports **MUST** support TLSv1.2 and optionally any subsequent
         protocol published by the IETF.
      5. TLSv1.1 and all previous versions have known security issues and **MUST
         NOT** be supported by any service ports.
      6. To ensure that the connection can be trusted, all service ports
         **MUST** present a certificate issued by a trusted CA, such as those
         supported by major browsers.
      7. All TLS certificates **MUST NOT** have expired, and **MUST** be
         presented wth any required intermediate certificates.
      8. The EPP server name **MUST** match at least one `subjectAltName` field
         in all presented certificates (either exact match or wildcard).
      9. Service ports **MUST** use at least one of the ciphers recommended in
         RFC 9325 (or any successor document).

         server.
      2. The `<svDate>` element in the `<greeting>` **MUST** specify a time
         within 30 seconds of the current date and time as received from the NTP
         network.
      3. The `<version>` element in the <greeting> **MUST** be exactly `1.0`.
      4. All `<lang>` element(s) in the `<greeting>` **MUST** contain valid
         language codes. At least `en` **MUST** be included.
      5. All `<objURI>` element(s) in the `<greeting>` **MUST** contain XML
         namespace URIs that are appropriate. The only mandatory URI that
         **MUST** be present is the domain namespace URI. The host and contact
         namespace URIs may be required depending on the `epp.hostModel` and
         `general.minimalPublicDataSet` parameters.
      6. All `<extURI>` element(s) in the `<greeting>` **MUST** contain XML
         namespace URIs that have been registered in the IANA registry, and that
         the mandatory extensions are also included.
      7. `<extURI>` elements containing the following XML namespaces **MUST** be
         present in the `<greeting>`:
           * `urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:secDNS-1.1`
           * `urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:launch-1.0`

    Summary: contact <create> command test (if applicable for the registry type)
    Description: |
      This test attempts to create a number of contact objects, and validates
      the server's response. For example, the test will expect that the server
      will reject a command that creates an object with missing or invalid
      properties, but will accept a command to create an object with valid
      properties. Property values will be randomly generated but will contain

    Summary: domain <create> command test
    Description: |
      This test performs a series domain `<create>` commands, using pseudo-
      random ASCII domain names under each TLD in the TLD set. If the
      `general.minimalPublicDataSet` input parameter is `false`, then a contact
      object (containing pseudo-random contact information) will be created
      beforehand and used as the registrant. If the `epp.hostModel` parameter is
      `objects`, then two host objects with pseudo-random names will be created
      and used as the nameservers (otherwise the names will be provided as
      attributes).
  
      The client will perform several `<create>` commands, each of which will
      test certain aspects of the server's processing of those commands, for
      example:
  
      * to confirm that the server does not accept invalid values for object
        properties (such as domain name, registration period, registant ID,
        nameservers, and DS record parameters). Examples:
          * invalid domain
          * invalid period (1-10 years)
          * non-existent registrant
          * non-existent hosts
          * invalid DS/keyData record parameters
      * to confirm that the server does not accept commands which reference
        non-existent host/contact objects
      * to confirm the server supports all permitted client-assigned status
        codes
      * to confirm that the server rejects a `<create>` command which
        specifies a registrant contact (where the
        `general.minimalPublicDataSet` input parameter is `true`)
      * to confirm that the server rejects a `<create>` command which does not
        specify a registrant contact (where the
        `general.minimalPublicDataSet`) input parameter is `false`
      * to confirm that the server rejects a `<create>` command containing
        host objects when the `epp.hostModel` parameter is `attributes`
      * to confirm that the server rejects a `<create>` command containing
        host attributes when the `epp.hostModel` parameter is `objects`
      * to confirm that the the server which implements RFC 9154 accepts a
        `<create>` command without an authInfo command.
  
      Both registrar IDs (those specified in the `epp.clid01` and `epp.clid02`
      input parameters) will be used to create domains.
  
      Once the `<create>` commands have been processed, the client will then
      perform `<info>` commands to confirm that:
  
      * the `<roid>` element is valid and contains a repository ID registered
        with IANA;
      * the `<crDate>` and `<exDate>` elements are present and valid;
      * the `<crID>` and `<clID>` elements match the client ID used to create

    Summary: Registry object integrity test
    Description: |
      This test confirms that the EPP server will refuse a request to delete a
      linked object.
  
      If the `epp.hostModel` input parameter is `attributes`, **and** the
      `general.minimalPublicDataSet` input parameter is `true`, then this test
      will be skipped.
  
      The client will submit `<delete>` commands for any contact and host
      objects created during `epp-16`. The server **MUST** respond with a `2305`
      "Object association prohibits operation" error.
    Dependencies:
      - epp-16
  epp-18:
    Summary: domain <update> command test
    Description: |
      This test will confirm that the client is able to perform an `<update>`
      command on the domain names created in `epp-16`, including:
  
      * adding and removing client-assigned status codes
      * adding and removing nameservers (whether objects or attributes)
      * changing registrant object (if applicable)
      * adding and remove DNSSEC information
  
      The client will also confirm that it cannot perform an `<update>` command
      on a domain sponsored by another registrar, and that the server responds
      with a `2201` authorization error.
  
      Once the `<update>` commands have been processed, the client will then
      perform `<info>` commands to confirm that the changes have been correctly
      stored by the server.
    Input-Parameters:
    Dependencies:
      - epp-17
  epp-18:
    Summary: domain <renew> command test
    Description: |
      This test will confirm that the client is able to renew domain names.
  
      * Following a succesful `<renew>` command, the expiry date of the domain
        **MUST** have been increased by the period specified by the client;
      * Where a server supports RFC 3915, the domain **MUST** have an RGP
        status of `renewPeriod`;
      * The server **MUST** reject a `<renew>` command if it would result in
        the expiry date being more than 10 years into the future.
  
      The client will issue the `<renew>` commands and then perform `<info>`
      commands to ensure that the expiry date and RGP status of the domain are
      set correctly.
    Input-Parameters:
    Dependencies:
      - epp-16
  epp-19:
    Summary: domain <transfer> command test
    Description: |
      This test will confirm that the client is able to initiate a domain
      transfer.
  
      The client will perform an `<update>` command to set the authInfo code for
      the test domain (taken from the set created in `epp-16`) to a
      randomly-determined value. If the server implements RFC 9154, it **MUST**
      reject the `<update>` command if the authInfo code is insufficently
      secure.
  
      Then, using a second set of credentials, the client will connect to the
      EPP server and authenticate, submit `<transfer>` commands, and validate
      the responses.
  
      This test will confirm that:
  
      * the server rejects a `<transfer>` command with an invalid authInfo code
      * the server rejects a command which would extend the domain's validity
        period more than 10 years into the future
      * the server accepts a `<transfer>` command with a valid authInfo code
        and period.
  
      The client will use an `<info>` command to ensure that the
      `pendingTransfer` status code is added to the domain after a successul
      transfer request.
  
      Once the transfer request has been accepted, the sponsoring client will
      wait for a message to be received on the server's message queue, and will
      then approve the transfer.
  
      Once the gaining registrar has also received a message on the queue, the
      client will use an `<info>` command to confirm that:
  
      * the domain is now under the sponsorship of the gaining registrar
      * the authInfo code has been reset by the server (if the server supports
        RFC 9154).
    Dependencies:
      - epp-18
  epp-20:
    Summary: domain <transfer> rejection test
    Description:
      This test confirms that the server behaves correctly if the sponsoring
      registrar of a domain rejects a transfer request.
  
      The test procedure matches that of `epp-19`, but the transfer request will
      be rejected rather than approved. An `<info>` command will be used to
      confirm that the domain name remains under the sponsorship of the original
      registrar.
    Dependencies:
      - epp-18
    
  epp-21:
    Summary: domain <delete> command test
    Description: |
      This test will perform `<delete>` commands on the objects created during
      `epp-16` and will confirm that the server accepts the `<delete>` command
      with a `1xxx` response code.
  
      Once the `<delete>` commands have been processed, the client will perform
      `<info>` commands on the deleted to object to confirm that:
  
      * if the server responded to the `<delete>` command with a `1000`
        response, then the domain no longer exists
      * if the server responded to the `<delete>` command with a `1001`
        response, then the domain has the `pendingDelete` status and the
        `redemptionPeriod` RGP status.
    Dependencies:
      - epp-19
  epp-22:
    Summary: domain restore test (if applicable)
    Description: |
      This test will perform RGP restore operations on the objects deleted
      during `epp-21`, in order to confirm the correct operation of the server's
      implementation of RFC 3915.
  
      If the value of the `general.gracePeriodsSupported` parameter is false,
      this test will be skipped.
    Input-Parameters:
      - epp.restoreReportRequired
    Dependencies:
      - epp-21
  
  epp-23:
    Summary: host rename test (if applicable)
    Description: |
      This tests verifies the server's support for host rename operations.
  
      If the `epp.hostModel` input parameter is `attributes`, this test will
      be skipped.
  
      The client will perform `<update>` commands on the objects created during
      `epp-11` and will confirm that the server correctly accepts or rejects the
      commands, for example:
  
      * an `<update>` command which specifies a syntatically invalid host name
        is rejected;
      * an `<update>` command which places the object out-of-bailiwick is
        accepted;
      * an `<update>` command which places the object within a non-existent
        domain is rejected;
      * an `<update>` command which places the object within a domain sponsored
        by another registrar is rejected. The domain name(s) provided in the
        `epp.registeredNames` parameter will be used for this test.
      * an `<update>` command which places the object within a domain sponsored
        by the test client is accepted. A domain created during the `epp-13`
        test case will be used as the new parent domain.
  
      The client will then perform `<info>` commands on the objects successfully
      updated, to confirm that the server has correctly stored the updated
      values.
    Dependencies:
      - epp-13
  epp-24:
    Summary: host <delete> command test (if applicable)
    Description: |
      This test will perform `<delete>` commands on the objects created during
      `epp-11` and will confirm that the server accepts the `<delete>` command
      with a `1xxx` response code.
  
      Once the `<delete>` commands have been submitted, if a `1000` response was
      received from the server, the client will perform `<check>` and `<info>`
      commands to confirm that the objects have been deleted.
  
      If the `epp.hostModel` input parameter is `attributes`, this test will
      be skipped.

      3.1.1 of RFC 8334.
  
      For this test, it is assumed that the EPP server has been configured to
      use data (specifically the Domain Name Label List, as described in Section
      5.3.3.1 of RFC 9361) from the TMCH test environment.
  
      The client will connect to the EPP server using the provided credentials
      and will then perform a series of `<check>` commands, using the Launch
      extension to specify a value of `claims` for the `type` attribute of the
      `<launch:check>` element and the `<launch:phase>` element. It will then
      confirm that the server returns an appropriate response:
  
      * a `<check>` response for a domain that is present on the DNL contains
        the correct `<launch:claimKey>` element;
      * a `<check>` response for a domain that is NOT present on the DNL

      3.3.1 of RFC 8334.
  
      For this test, it is assumed that the EPP server has been configured to
      use data (specifically the Domain Name Label List, as described in Section
      5.3.3.1 of RFC 9361) from the TMCH test environment.
  
      The client will connect to the EPP server and will submit `<create>`
      commands, using domain names and SMD files present in the TMCH test
      environment.
  
      If the server supports Start Date sunrises, the fully-qualified domain
      name will be constructed using a label from the SMD file and the
      `minimumRPMS.sunriseTLD` input parameter. The Server **MUST** respond with
      a `1000` or `1001` result code, however, if the client receives a `2302`
      "object exists" result code, it will retry with a different domain name.
  
      The client will also attempt to create a domain using an invalid SMD,
      which the server **MUST** reject.
  
      If the server supports End Date sunrises, the fully-qualified domain
      name will be constructed using a label from the SMD file and the
      `minimumRPMS.sunriseTLD` input parameter. The Server **MUST** respond with
      a `1000` or `1001` result code.
  
      Once the `<create>` commands have been processed, the client will then
      perform `<info>` commands to confirm that the domains have been created and
      that the submitted object properties have been correctly stored.
  
      The client will also confirm that the server rejects attempts to:
  
      1. create a domain using an invalid SMD;
      2. create a domain using a revoked SMD;
      3. create a domain using an SMD signed by a revoked certificate.

      The client will connect to the EPP server and will submit `<create>`
      commands, using domain names present in the TMCH test environment.
  
      The domain name will be constructed using a label from the DNL, and the
      `minimumRPMS.claimsTLD` input parameter. The client will perform a
      Trademark Claims `<check>` command beforehand to obtain the claim key, and
      will then synthesise a trademark claims acknowledgement. The server
      **MUST** respond with a 1000 or 10001 response.
  
      Once the `<create>` commands have been processed, the client will then
      perform `<info>` commands to confirm that the domains have been created and
      that the submitted object properties have been correctly stored.
  
      The client will also confirm that the server rejects attempts to:
  
      1. create a domain using an invalid claim key;
      2. create a domain using an expired claim key;
      3. create a domain using an acceptance datetime more than 48 hours in the
