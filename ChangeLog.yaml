  - Documented the [test sequence](#Preamble-2.5.-Test-sequence).
  - In order to simplify the specifications and avoid confusion, inter-case dependencies have been removed from the HTML representation.
  - Added the [DNS_INCONSISTENT_RESPONSES](#Error-DNS_INCONSISTENT_RESPONSES) to all test cases in the [DNS](#Test-Suite-StandardDNS) and [DNSSEC](#Test-Suite-StandardDNSSEC) suites.

  - "Case maturity metrics: ALPHA <1% (no change), BETA 50% (no change), GAMMA 50% (no change)"

2024-02-21:
  - The [ZM_NAMESERVER_IP_PRIVATE_NETWORK](#Error-ZM_NAMESERVER_IP_PRIVATE_NETWORK) error now has `CRITICAL` severity.
  - The suites that use an Input Parameter are now listed, in addition to any test cases.
  - All cases in the [Minimum RPMs](#Test-Suite-MinimumRPMs) suite are now at BETA maturity, except for [minimumRPMs-03](#Test-Case-minimumRPMs-03), which may change due to anticipated changes to the Trademark Claims policy.
  - All cases in the [DNSSEC Operations](#Test-Suite-DNSSECOperations) suite are now at BETA maturity.
  - Clarified wording of the [DNSSEC Operations](#Test-Suite-DNSSECOperations) test cases and added configuration guidance for applicants.
  - Any DNS query or XFR that fails during the [DNSSEC Operations](#Test-Suite-DNSSECOperations) suite is now an error.
  - Added the [epp.tlsCertificateStore](#resource-epp.tlsCertificateStore) resource to [rdap-91](#Test-Case-rdap-91).
  - Added new test plans that will only be available in OT&E, to allow testing of specific test suites.
  - Added the `OTE-Only` property to test plan objects indicating the above, and bumped the schema version accordingly.
  - All error messages are now documented.
  - "Case maturity metrics: ALPHA <1% (-5%), BETA 50% (+7%), GAMMA 50% (+0%)"

2024-02-14:
  - Links to references and notes about upgraded message severities in Zonemaster cases have been fixed.
  - the [epp.greeting](#Input-Parameter-epp.greeting) input parameter is now a file upload.
  - added schemas to all input parameters that didn't have them.
  - "Case maturity metrics: ALPHA 7% (+2%), BETA 43% (-14%), GAMMA 50% (+12%)"

2024-02-07:
  - Zonemaster cases are now generated directly from [Zonemaster::Engine](https://metacpan.org/dist/Zonemaster-Engine), so now include all possible error messages.
  - Rather than placing "common" errors at the suite level, each case now lists all the errors it may emit. In the HTML output, the cases that may emit an error are listed for each error.
  - Began providing descriptions of errors, and adjusting their severity levels accordingly.
  - Protocol-related errors are now standardised, so for example, the SRSGW and IDN cases use the same errors as the EPP cases, for EPP-related errors.
  - The way that the specification version is calculated has changed to accommodate the new release process (now that the repository has multiple branches, counting commits can result in two files having the same version).
  - "Case maturity metrics: ALPHA 5% (-2%), BETA 57% (-17%), GAMMA 38% (+19%)"

2024-01-31:
  - Added this ChangeLog.
  - Add content of NS records to the list of names checked in [dns-zz-idna2008-compliance](#Test-Case-dns-zz-idna2008-compliance).
