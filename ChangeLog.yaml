2024-10-02:
  - Miscellaneous minor fixes.
  - |
    Fixed the schema for the
    `srsgw.eppRequiredContactElements`](#Input-Parameter-srsgw.eppRequiredContactElements)
    input parameter.

2024-09-25:
  - |
    The [`epp.clientACL`](#resource-epp.clientACL),
    [`integration.rdeSFTPACL`](#resource-integration.rdeSFTPACL) and
    [`dnssecOps.xfrACL`](#resource-dnssecOps.xfrACL) resources may now contain
    CIDR prefixes as well as IP addresses.
  - |
    Added [`EPP_GENERIC_COMMAND_ERROR`](#Error-EPP_GENERIC_COMMAND_ERROR) to all
    EPP-related test cases.

2024-09-18:
  - |
    Updates to test cases in the [RDE test suit](#Test-Suite-StandardRDE)
    resulting from internal review.
  - |
    Several EPP-related input parameters now have [SRS
    Gateway](#Test-Suite-StandardSRSGateway)-specific equivalents, as it is
    possible to allow the SRS Gateway EPP server to have a different data model
    to the primary EPP server.
  - |
    Clarified that IP-related tests are only applicable for internal hosts in
    [epp-13](#Test-Case-epp-13).
  - |
    Replaced the `epp.clientCertificate` and `epp.clientCSR` resources with
    [`epp.client01Certificate`](#Resource-epp.client01Certificate) and
    [`epp.client02Certificate`](#Resource-epp.client02Certificate), and
    [`epp.client01CSR`](#Resource-epp.client01CSR) and
    [`epp.client02CSR`](#Resource-epp.client02CSR) respectively, so each
    client can use a distinct certificate.
2024-09-12:
  - |
    The version of Zonemaster that the DNS and DNSSEC test suites use has been
    changed from `2023.1.4` to `2024.1`. The changes in Zonemaster between these
    versions may be found in the [release
    notes](https://github.com/zonemaster/zonemaster/releases/) on GitHub.
  - |
    The `idn-01`, `idn-02`, `idn-03`, `idn-04` and `idn-06` have been folded
    into a [single test case (a new `idn-01`)](#Test-Case-idn-01), as a single
    implementation will perform all the tests.
  - As a result of the above, `idn-05` is now [`idn-02`](#Test-Case-idn-02).
  - |
    In [epp-20](#Test-Case-epp-20), the domain must not have the `pendingTransfer`
    status after the transfer is rejected.
  - |
    Clarified how the [`epp.restoreReportRequired`](#Input-Parameter-epp.restoreReportRequired)
    input parameter affects the restore request in [epp-22](#Test-Case-epp-22).
  - |
    Updated [epp-23](#Test-Case-epp-23) to be stand-alone and also use a data
    provider.
  - Updated [epp-24](#Test-Case-epp-24) to be stand-alone.
  - Added informative references to each test suite.
2024-09-04:
  - |
    Upgraded **SHOULD** to **MUST** for
    [`epp.serverIssuedClientCertificate01`](#Input-Parameter-epp.serverIssuedClientCertificate01),
    [`epp.serverIssuedClientCertificate02`](#Input-Parameter-epp.serverIssuedClientCertificate02),
    [`epp.registeredNameservers`](#Input-Parameter-epp.registeredNameservers) and
    [`epp.registeredContacts`](#Input-Parameter-epp.registeredContacts).
  - |
    Clarified that the values of the
    [`dnssecOps.zskRolloverZone`](#Input-Parameter-dnssecOps.zskRolloverZone),
    [`dnssecOps.kskRolloverZone`](#Input-Parameter-dnssecOps.kskRolloverZone),
    [`dnssecOps.algorithmRolloverZone`](#Input-Parameter-dnssecOps.algorithmRolloverZone)
    input parameters must be different.
  - |
    The [`rdap.testDomains`](#Input-Parameter-rdap.testDomains) parameter is
    now an object with the same schema as the other input parameters for the
    RDAP suite.
  - Added the [`rdap.profileVersion`](#Input-Parameter-rdap.profileVersion)
    input parameter.

2024-08-30:
  - Fixed test data sets in [epp-11-data](#Data-Provider-epp-11-data).

2024-08-20:
  - Added a data provider to [epp-11](#Test-Case-epp-11).

2024-07-31:
  - |
    The schema has been updated to add an `Implemented` property to test cases,
    allowing the proportion of implemented test cases to be reported for each
    suite and plan.
  - Added data providers to some EPP test cases.
  - Resolved error message inconsistency in [epp-16](#Test-Case-epp-16).
  - Further clarifications to [epp-17](#Test-Case-epp-17).
  - Made [epp-18](#Test-Case-epp-18) standalone.
  - Made [epp-19](#Test-Case-epp-19) standalone.
  - Made [epp-21](#Test-Case-epp-21) standalone.
  - Made [epp-22](#Test-Case-epp-22) standalone.

2024-07-24:
  - Clarified the description of [epp-17](#Test-Case-epp-17).

2024-07-17:
  - |
    EPP-related test cases are being revised to avoid reuse of objects created
    previous test cases. Instead, each test case will be "standalone", and will
    created any required objects itself. Any such objects will be deleted when
    the test case is finished. Any test case that still describes the reuse of
    objects created in a previous test case will eventually be updated to become
    "standalone" and should be read as such.
  - Fixed the type of [`srsgw.serverIssuedClientCertificate01`](#Input-Parameter-srsgw.serverIssuedClientCertificate01).
  - |
    Revised the error codes for [epp-07](#Test-Case-epp-07), and the data
    provider, so that elements that can be empty do not result in errors when
    empty values are accepted by the server.
  - |
    Clarified the relationship between the items in the
    [`epp.registeredNameservers`](#Input-Parameter-epp.registeredNameservers)
    input parameters and the TLDs in the TLD set. This input parameter is now
    also optional.
  - |
    Updated the definition of the
    [`epp.registeredContacts`](#Input-Parameter-epp.registeredContacts) to make
    a bit more sense. This is also now optional.
  - Added a list of namespace URIs to [rde-05](#Test-Case-rde-05).
  - |
    Updated the test procedure for [srsgw-15](#Test-Case-srsgw-15), and added a
    reference to [RFC 8785](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8785). The two
    RDAP responses may have different "last update of RDAP database" events.
  - |
    Added data providers to [epp-13](#Test-Case-epp-13) and
    [epp-14](#Test-Case-epp-14).

2024-07-03:
  - |
    The [epp-07](#Test-Case-epp-07) and [epp-09](#Test-Case-epp-09) test cases
    have been updated to use the newly-added
    [`epp.supportedContactElements`](#Input-Parameter-epp.supportedContactElements)
    and [`epp.requiredContactElements`](#Input-Parameter-epp.requiredContactElements)
    input parameters.
  - |
    The [epp-07-data](#Data-Provider-epp-07-data) data provider has been updated
    to correct the error codes generated when the server accepts a `<voice>`
    element with invalid content.
  - |
    The [`dns.nameservers`](#Input-Parameter-dns.nameservers) input parameter
    has been updated to allow different nameservers to be specified for each TLD
    being tested. The description of the [DNS](#Test-Suite-StandardDNS) has been
    updated to reflect this change.
  - |
    Documented [Test TLDs for RSP
    Evaluation](#Preamble-2.6.-Test-TLDs-for-RSP%0AEvaluation).
  - |
    Updated the test cases in the [Integration test
    suite](#Test-Suite-StandardIntegrationTest) to be independent from each
    other.

2024-06-26:
  - Correct errors in [epp-12](#Test-Case-epp-12).
  - |
    Added the [`srsgw.domainCreateExtension`](#Input-Parameter-srsgw.domainCreateExtension),
    [`srsgw.domainDeleteExtension`](#Input-Parameter-srsgw.domainDeleteExtension),
    [`srsgw.domainRenewExtension`](#Input-Parameter-srsgw.domainRenewExtension),
    [`srsgw.domainTransferRequestExtension`](#Input-Parameter-srsgw.domainTransferRequestExtension) and
    [`srsgw.domainTransferApproveExtension`](#Input-Parameter-srsgw.domainTransferApproveExtension)
    input parameters, and the [`SRSGW_EPP_INVALID_EXTENSION`](#Error-SRSGW_EPP_INVALID_EXTENSION) error.
  - Added the [Additional DNS Transports](#Test-Plan-AdditionalDNSTransportsTest) plan.
  - |
    The [RDAP test suite](#Test-Suite-StandardEPP) has been significantly
    refactored to split out separate test cases for [domain](#Test-case-rdap-01),
    [nameserver](#Test-case-rdap-02), [registrar](#Test-case-rdap-03) and
    [help](#Test-case-rdap-04) queries. The test coverage has not changed (since
    the RDAP Conformance Tool will still be used), this change is mainly to
    ensure that any errors are properly associated with the type of query being
    performed.

2024-06-05:
  - This is the first release since the end of the [Public Comment](https://www.icann.org/en/public-comment/proceeding/review-of-the-registry-system-testing-20-test-specifications-and-api-26-03-2024) proceeding.
  - The specification has been updated to include *data providers* which are associated with test cases.
  - Clarified that the [epp-05](#Test-Case-epp-05) test case will be skipped if the server uses host attributes.
  - Clarified that the [epp-06](#Test-Case-epp-06) test case will be skipped if the `general.registryDataModel` input parameter is `minimum`.
  - Updated the wording of [epp-08](#Test-Case-epp-08) to clarify that both `<info>` and `<update>` commands will be used.
  - Updated [epp-04](#Test-Case-epp-04) to clarify that the [`epp.registeredNames`](#Input-Parameter-epp.registeredNames) input parameter will be used in this test case.
  - Added [idn-02](#Test-Case-idn-02) which checks that the EPP server rejects `<create>` commands for pure ASCII domains in TLDs that are IDN-only.
  - Added [idn-06](#Test-Case-idn-06) which checks that the EPP server rejects `<create>` commands for domains that do not comply with the requirements of IDNA2008.
  - Updated [idn-01](#Test-Case-idn-01) to include `<check>` commands for valid and invalid labels.
  - Input parameters now have a boolean `Required` parameter indicating whether they are required or optional. Where the description of the input parameter previously said that the value must be empty, it now says it must be omitted.
  - If a port is specified in an RDAP Base URL, it **MUST** be `443`.
  - |
    The [`DNS_INCONSISTENT_RESPONSES`](#Error-DNS_INCONSISTENT_RESPONSES) error
    has been removed from all test cases in the DNS and DNSSEC test cases, and a
    new test case, [dns-zz-consistency](#Test-Case-dns-zz-consistency) has been
    added which will perform consistency checks using the SLA Monitoring system
    (SLAM).
  - |
    The [`dns.nameservers`](#Input-Parameter-dns.nameservers) input parameter has
    been updated to add the `supportsDoT`, `supportsDoH` and `supportsDoQ`
    boolean flags to nameservers. This allows test subjects to indicate whether
    a nameserver supports DoT, DoH or DoQ, respectively.

2024-03-26:
  - This is the final release of the test specifications before the start of the Public Comment. No changes to the specification will be published until after the Public Comment process has been completed.
  - |
    Since the [Registration Data Policy](https://www.icann.org/resources/pages/registration-data-policy-2024-02-21-en#trd-registrar-registry)
    allows for different registry data models to apply to different registrar accounts (depending on whether or not there is an appropriate
    legal basis, and data processing agreement is in place), the `general.minimalPublicDataSet` input parameter has been replaced with
    [`general.registryDataModel`](#Input-Parameter-general.registryDataModel), which is an enum. To support this, the
    [`epp.clid01DataModel`](#Input-Parameter-epp.clid01DataModel) and [`epp.clid02DataModel`](#Input-Parameter-epp.clid02DataModel) input
    parameters have been added, so that different registry data models can be specified for each registrar account.
  - The algorithm mnemonics that can be specified in the [`dnssecOps.tsigKey`](#Input-Parameter-dnssecOps.tsigKey) input parameter have been restricted to those that are (a) applicable for DNS and (b) secure.
  - Error messages extracted from Zonemaster now include the tag descriptions from `Zonemaster::Engine`.
  - In [minimumRPMs-03](#Test-Case-minimumRPMs-03), the maximum time period between when the trademark claim notice acknowledgement and the submission of the domain `<create>` command has been increased from 48 hours to one year. The maturity of this test has been changed to BETA.
  - "Case maturity metrics: ALPHA 0% (-1%), BETA 0% (-50%), GAMMA 100% (+50%)."

2024-03-20:
  - Clarified the elements that will be tested in [epp-07](#Test-Case-epp-07).
  - Added `Configuration` section to the YAML file which holds internal test system configuration parameters.
  - "Case maturity metrics: ALPHA <1% (no change), BETA 50% (no change), GAMMA 50% (no change)"

2024-03-13:
  - Added a number of new errors to [epp-07](#Test-Case-epp-07).
  - In [rde-07](#Test-Case-rde-07), clarify that a domain with the `pendingDelete` status can have an `<exDate>` element that is before the watermark.
  - "Case maturity metrics: ALPHA <1% (no change), BETA 50% (no change), GAMMA 50% (no change)"

2024-02-28:
  - Added the [EPP_GREETING_MISSING_EN_LANG](#Error-EPP_GREETING_MISSING_EN_LANG) error to [epp-02](#Test-Case-epp-02). The circumstances under which the [EPP_GREETING_RECOMMENDED_EXTENSION_MISSING](#Error-EPP_GREETING_RECOMMENDED_EXTENSION_MISSING) warning will be produced have been clarified.
  - Various changes to input parameter schema to address issues with OpenAPI code generators not being able to support various JSON Schema features.
  - The [dnssecOps.primaryServer](#Input-Parameter-dnssecOps.primaryServers) input parameter has been changed to an array to allow for multiple servers to be specified.
  - Documented the [test sequence](#Preamble-2.5.-Test-sequence).
  - In order to simplify the specifications and avoid confusion, inter-case dependencies have been removed from the HTML representation.
  - Added the [DNS_INCONSISTENT_RESPONSES](#Error-DNS_INCONSISTENT_RESPONSES) to all test cases in the [DNS](#Test-Suite-StandardDNS) and [DNSSEC](#Test-Suite-StandardDNSSEC) suites.
  - Upgraded the [ZM_RNAME_MISUSED_AT_SIGN](#Error-ZM_RNAME_MISUSED_AT_SIGN) and [ZM_DIFFERENT_SOURCE_IP](#Error-ZM_DIFFERENT_SOURCE_IP) errors to `ERROR`.
  - "Case maturity metrics: ALPHA <1% (no change), BETA 50% (no change), GAMMA 50% (no change)"

2024-02-21:
  - The [ZM_NAMESERVER_IP_PRIVATE_NETWORK](#Error-ZM_NAMESERVER_IP_PRIVATE_NETWORK) error now has `CRITICAL` severity.
  - The suites that use an Input Parameter are now listed, in addition to any test cases.
  - All cases in the [Minimum RPMs](#Test-Suite-MinimumRPMs) suite are now at BETA maturity, except for [minimumRPMs-03](#Test-Case-minimumRPMs-03), which may change due to anticipated changes to the Trademark Claims policy.
  - All cases in the [DNSSEC Operations](#Test-Suite-DNSSECOperations) suite are now at BETA maturity.
  - Clarified wording of the [DNSSEC Operations](#Test-Suite-DNSSECOperations) test cases and added configuration guidance for applicants.
  - Any DNS query or XFR that fails during the [DNSSEC Operations](#Test-Suite-DNSSECOperations) suite is now an error.
  - Added the [epp.tlsCertificateStore](#Resource-epp.tlsCertificateStore) resource to [rdap-91](#Test-Case-rdap-91).
  - Added new test plans that will only be available in OT&E, to allow testing of specific test suites.
  - Added the `OTE-Only` property to test plan objects indicating the above, and bumped the schema version accordingly.

2024-02-14:
  - Links to references and notes about upgraded message severities in Zonemaster cases have been fixed.
  - The [epp.greeting](#Input-Parameter-epp.greeting) input parameter is now a file upload.
  - Added schemas to all input parameters that didn't have them.
  - "Case maturity metrics: ALPHA 7% (+2%), BETA 43% (-14%), GAMMA 50% (+12%)"

2024-02-07:
  - Zonemaster cases are now generated directly from [Zonemaster::Engine](https://metacpan.org/dist/Zonemaster-Engine), so now include all possible error messages.
  - Rather than placing "common" errors at the suite level, each case now lists all the errors it may emit. In the HTML output, the cases that may emit an error are listed for each error.
  - Began providing descriptions of errors, and adjusting their severity levels accordingly.
  - Protocol-related errors are now standardised, so for example, the SRSGW and IDN cases use the same errors as the EPP cases, for EPP-related errors.
  - The way that the specification version is calculated has changed to accommodate the new release process (now that the repository has multiple branches, counting commits can result in two files having the same version).
  - "Case maturity metrics: ALPHA 5% (-2%), BETA 57% (-17%), GAMMA 38% (+19%)"

2024-01-31:
  - Added this ChangeLog.

  - Added additional error codes to [epp-16](#Test-Case-epp-16).
  - Added check for `transferPeriod` RGP status to [epp-19](#Test-Case-epp-19).
  - Add [epp-25](#Test-Case-epp-25) test case.
  - "Case maturity metrics: ALPHA 7% , BETA 74%, GAMMA 19%"
