2024-02-14:
  - Links to references and notes about upgraded message severities in Zonemaster cases have been fixed.
  - the [`epp.greeting`](#Input-Parameter-epp.greeting) input parameter is now a file upload.
  - added schemas to all input parameters that didn't have them.
  - "Case maturity metrics: ALPHA XX% (-XX%), BETA XX% (-XX%), GAMMA XX% (+XX%)"

2024-02-07:
  - Zonemaster cases are now generated directly from [`Zonemaster::Engine`](https://metacpan.org/dist/Zonemaster-Engine), so now include all possible error messages.
  - Rather than placing "common" errors at the suite level, each case now lists all the errors it may emit. In the HTML output, the cases that may emit an error are listed for each error.
  - Began providing descriptions of errors, and adjusting their severity levels accordingly.
  - Protocol-related errors are now standardised, so for example, the SRSGW and IDN cases use the same errors as the EPP cases, for EPP-related errors.
  - The way that the specification version is calculated has changed to accommodate the new release process (now that the repository has multiple branches, counting commits can result in two files having the same version).
  - "Case maturity metrics: ALPHA 5% (-2%), BETA 57% (-17%), GAMMA 38% (+19%)"
