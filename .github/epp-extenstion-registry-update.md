The `monitor-extension-registry` workflow has detected that the [EPP Extension Registry](https://www.iana.org/assignments/epp-extensions) has been updated.

The changes to the registry must be reflected in the [EPP Extension List](https://github.com/icann/rst-test-specs/blob/main/epp-extensions/epp-extensions.yaml).
