  Summary: IPv4 and IPv6 connectivity
  Maturity: BETA
  Description: |
    This test confirms that the SRS Gateway EPP system is reachable over IPv4
    and IPv6.

  Summary: Host <create> synchronization (if applicable)
  Maturity: BETA
  Description: |
    This test confirms that host objects created in the SRS Gateway EPP system
    are correctly synchronized with the primary registry system.

    If the value of the `epp.hostModel` input parameter is `attributes`, then
    this test will be skipped.

    The client will connect to the SRS Gateway EPP system, authenticate, and
    submit a `<create>` command for a pseudo-randomly generated host name.
