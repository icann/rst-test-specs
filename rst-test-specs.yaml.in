Preamble: |
  The Test System consists of several *test plans*, each of which addresses a
  particular scenario. The test plans follow a structure and methodology derived
  from ISO/IEC 29119 *(formerly IEEE 829-2008)*.

  Each *test plan* includes one or more *test suites*, which in turn include
  one or more *test cases*. For a test to succeed, every test case in every
  test suite has to pass.

  This file describes each test plan, suite and case in the RST system, as well
  as the input parameters required for each.

  ### 2.1. Key acronyms and terms

Test-Plans:
  StandardPreDelegationTest:
    Order: 1
    Name: Pre-Delegation Test
    Description: |
      The purpose of the Pre-Delegation Test is to verify that the applicant has
      met its commitment to establish registry operations in accordance with the
      technical and operational criteria described in the gTLD Applicant
      Guidebook (AGB). Each applicant will be required to complete PDT as a
      prerequisite to delegation into the root zone.

      The Pre-Delegation Test covers all critical registry services and IDNs,
      and therefore uses all test suites.
    Test-Suites:
      - StandardDNS
      - StandardDNSSEC

  StandardRSPChangeTest:
    Order: 2
    Name: RSP Change Test
    Description: |
      A Registry Operator may apply to ICANN to change a Material Subcontracting
      Arrangement (MSA) and appoint a new Registry Services Provider. Before
      this change can be approved, the new RSP MUST complete Registry System
      Testing to ensure their systems comply with the technical and operational
      requirements of the Registry Agreement.

      The RSP Change Test covers all critical registry services and IDNs, and
      therefore uses all test suites.
    Test-Suites:
      - StandardDNS
      - StandardDNSSEC
      - StandardEPP
      - StandardIDN
      - StandardRDAP

  DNSRSPChangeTest:
    Order: 3
    Name: DNS RSP Change Test
    Description: |
      A Registry Operator may apply to ICANN to change a Material Subcontracting
      Arrangement (MSA) and appoint a new provider of authoritative DNS services
      instead of or in addition to any existing provider(s).

      Before this change can be approved, the new DNS provider MUST complete
      testing to ensure their systems comply with the technical and operational
      requirements of the Registry Agreement.

      The DNS RSP Change Test uses the DNS test suite only.
    Test-Suites:
      - StandardDNS
      - StandardDNSSEC

  IDNTest:
    Order: 4
    Name: IDN Test
    Description: |
      A Registry Operator may apply to ICANN to amend its Registry Agreement
      to offer new scripts and/or languages for Internationalized Domain Names.

      The purpose of an IDN RST test is to verify that the Registry Operator’s
      registry system handles IDN registrations in accordance with the
      submitted policy statements and IDN tables.

      The IDN Test uses the IDN test suite only.
    Test-Suites:
      - StandardIDN

  SRSGatewayTest:
    Order: 5
    Name: SRS Gateway Test
    Description: |
      An SRS Gateway service is a Shared Registry System implementation that
      acts as a proxy between a subset of Registrars and the Registry. It uses
      a local cache to speed up EPP query commands, but forwards all EPP
      transform commands to the TLD Registry System. TLD registries need to
      deploy a proxy setup in order to operate in certain markets worldwide.

      The purpose of an SRS Gateway Test is to verify that the Registry
      Operator’s proxy setup operates in accordance with the technical and
      operational criteria for EPP systems described in the gTLD Applicant
      Guidebook (AGB). Furthermore, it MUST keep its own database synchronized
      with that of the TLD registry.

      The SRS Gateway Test Change Test uses the SRS gateway test suite only.
    Test-Suites:
      - StandardSRSGateway

  StandardDNS:
    Order: 1
    Name: Authoritative DNS Service
    Description: |
      The DNS test suite validates the authoritative DNS services for the TLD

      The DNS test suite is taken from the test plans that are part of the
      [Zonemaster software](https://github.com/zonemaster) (`Zonemaster::Engine`
      version v4.7.3). Test case IDs from this document can be mapped to the
      Zonemaster test IDs by removing the `dns-` prefix.

      Since Zonemaster is designed to perform testing of domain names anywhere
      in the DNS hierarchy, not all Zonemaster tests are applicable for TLDs and
      may not be listed in the test suites in this document.

      ## Testing of Anycast networks using multiple vantage points

      In order to test anycast networks without requiring RSPs to provide the
      unicast adresses of their nodes, all tests carried out over the network
      will be performed from multiple vantage points. All vantage points MUST
      receive the same response in order for the tests to pass.

  dnssecOps01-ZSKRollover:
    Summary: ZSK rollover
    Description: |
      This test case verifies the RSP's ability to perform a ZSK rollover for a
      zone.

      The system will monitor the SOA record in the domain name specified in the
      `dnssec.zskRolloverZone` input parameter. The domain may be present
      anywhere in the DNS hierarchy (that is, it does not need to be a TLD), but
      MUST have a secure chain of trust up to the root zone, so that it can be
      validated using the root zone trust anchor.

      During the test period (currently defined as 24 hours) the operator MUST
      successfully carry out a ZSK rollover for the domain, where the Zone
      Signing Key is replaced, without disrupting the chain of trust.

      To simplify testing, applicants may wish to provision domain that is
      configured with short TTLs and a short ZSK lifetime, so that a ZSK
      rollover is guaranteed to occur within the 24 test period.
    Input-Parameters:
      - dnssecOps.zskRolloverZone
    Dependencies:
  dnssecOps02-KSKRollover:
    Summary: KSK rollover
    Description: |

      `dnssec.kskRolloverZone` input parameter. The domain may be present
      anywhere in the DNS hierarchy (that is, it does not need to be a TLD), but
      MUST have a secure chain of trust up to the root zone, so that it can be
      validated using the root zone trust anchor.

      During the test period (currently defined as 24 hours) the operator MUST
      successfully carry out a KSK rollover for the domain, where the Key
      Signing Key is replaced, and the DS record in the parent zone is updated,
      without disrupting the chain of trust.
    Input-Parameters:
      - dnssecOps.kskRolloverZone
    Dependencies:
  dnssecOps03-AlgorithmRollover:
    Summary: algorithm rollover
    Description: |

      for a zone.

      The system will monitor the SOA record in the domain name specified in the
      `dnssec.algorithmRolloverZone` input parameter. The domain may be present
      anywhere in the DNS hierarchy (that is, it does not need to be a TLD), but
      MUST have a secure chain of trust up to the root zone, so that it can be
      validated using the root zone trust anchor.

      During the test period (currently defined as 72 hours) the operator MUST
      successfully carry out an algorithm rollover for the domain, where the
      algorithm used to secure the domain is changed, without disrupting the
      chain of trust.

      and used as the nameservers (otherwise the names will be provided as
      attributes).

      The client will perform several `<create>` commands, each of which will
      test certain aspects of the server's processing of those commands, for
      example:

          specifies a contact object (where the `general.minimumPublicDataSet`)
          input parameter is `true`
        * to confirm that the server rejects a `<create>` command which does not
          specify a contact object (where the `general.minimumPublicDataSet`)
          input parameter is `false`
        * to confirm that the server rejects a `<create>` command containing
          host objects when the `epp.hostModel` parameter is `attributes`
        * to confirm that the server rejects a `<create>` command containing
          host attributes when the `epp.hostModel` parameter is `objects`

    Summary: domain <transfer> command test
    Description: |
      This test will confirm that the client is able to initiate a domain
      transfer.

      The client will perform an `<update>` command to set the authInfo code for
      the test domain (taken from the set created in `epp-32`) to a
      randomly-determined value.

      Then, using a second set of credentials, the client will connect to the
      EPP server and authenticate, submit `<transfer>` commands, and validate
      the responses.

      This test will confirm that:

      * the server rejects a `<transfer>` command with an invalid authInfo code
      * the server rejects a command which would extend the domain's validity
        period more than 10 years into the future
      * the server accepts a `<transfer>` command with a valid authInfo code
        and period.

      Once the transfer request has been accepted, the sponsoring client will
      wait for a message to be received on the server's message queue, and will
      then approve the transfer.

      Once the gaining registrar has also received a message on the queue, the
      client will confirm that:

      * the domain is now under the sponsorship of the gaining registrar
      * the authInfo code has been reset by the server (if the server supports
        RFC 9154).
