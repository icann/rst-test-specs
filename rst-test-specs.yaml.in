Preamble: |
  The Test System consists of several *test plans*, each of which addresses a
  particular scenario. Each *test plan* includes one or more *test suites*,
  which in turn include one or more *test cases*.

  This file describes each test [plan](#test-plans), [suite](#test-suites) and
  [case](#test-cases) in the RST system, as well as the
  [input parameters](#input-parameters) required for each, relevant
  [resources](#resources), any inter-case dependencies, and the
  [errors](#errors) that might occur during testing.

  ### 2.1. Pass/fail criteria

  In all cases, for a test to pass, **all** the test cases specified in the test
  suite(s) for the test plan must pass: if **any** fail, then the test as a
  whole will fail.

  A test case will fail if it produces one or more [errors](#errors) with the
  `ERROR` or `CRITICAL` severities.

  #### 2.1.1. Error severity levels

  1. `WARNING` - an issue which is not sufficiently severe to justify a
     higher severity, but which may suggest an issue that should be
     investigated.
  2. `ERROR` - an issue which prevents the test from *passing*, but does not
     prevent the test from *continuing*. A test may produce multiple `ERROR`
     results.
  3. `CRITICAL` - an issue which prevents the test from continuing any
     further. A test will only produce a single `CRITICAL` result and it
     will always be the last result in the log.

    Name: SRS Gateway Test
    Description: |
      An SRS Gateway service is a Shared Registry System implementation that
      acts as a proxy between a subset of Registrars and the Registry. It uses
      a local cache to speed up EPP query commands, but forwards all EPP
      transform commands to the primary registry system. TLD registries need to
      deploy a proxy setup in order to operate in certain markets worldwide.

      The purpose of an SRS Gateway Test is to verify that the Registry
      Operator’s proxy setup operates in accordance with the technical and
      operational criteria for EPP systems described in the gTLD Applicant
      Guidebook (AGB). Furthermore, it MUST keep its own database synchronized
      with that of the TLD registry.

      The SRS Gateway Test Change Test uses the SRS gateway test suite only.

  dnssecOps01-ZSKRollover:
    Summary: ZSK rollover
    Description: |
      This test case verifies the RSP's ability to perform a ZSK rollover (as
      described in [Section 4.1.1 of
      RFC6781](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6781#section-4.1.1) for
      a zone.

      If the value of the `dnssecOps.csk` input parameter is `true`, then this
      test will be skipped.

      The system will monitor the SOA record in the domain name specified in the
      `dnssec.zskRolloverZone` input parameter. The domain may be present
      anywhere in the DNS hierarchy (that is, it does not need to be a TLD), but
      MUST have a secure chain of trust up to the root zone, so that it can be
      validated using the root zone trust anchor.

      During the test period (currently defined as 24 hours) the operator MUST
      successfully carry out a ZSK rollover for the domain, where the Zone
      Signing Key is replaced, without disrupting the chain of trust.

      To simplify testing, applicants may wish to provision domain that is
      configured with short TTLs and a short ZSK lifetime, so that a ZSK
      rollover is guaranteed to occur within the 24 test period.
    Input-Parameters:
      - dnssecOps.csk
      - dnssecOps.zskRolloverZone
    Dependencies:
  dnssecOps02-KSKRollover:
    Summary: KSK rollover
    Description: |
      This test case verifies the RSP's ability to perform a CSK/KSK rollover
      (as described in [Sections 4.1.2 and 4.13 of
      RFC6781](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6781#section-4.1.2) for
      a zone.

      The system will monitor the SOA record in the domain name specified in the
      `dnssec.kskRolloverZone` input parameter. The domain may be present
      anywhere in the DNS hierarchy (that is, it does not need to be a TLD), but
      MUST have a secure chain of trust up to the root zone, so that it can be
      validated using the root zone trust anchor.

      During the test period (currently defined as 24 hours) the operator MUST
      successfully carry out a KSK rollover for the domain, where the Key
      Signing Key is replaced, and the DS record in the parent zone is updated,
      without disrupting the chain of trust.
    Input-Parameters:
      - dnssecOps.kskRolloverZone
    Dependencies:
  dnssecOps03-AlgorithmRollover:
    Summary: algorithm rollover
    Description: |
      This test case verifies the RSP's ability to perform an algorithm rollover
      (as described in [Section 4.1.4 of
      RFC6781](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6781#section-4.1.2) for
      a zone.

      The system will monitor the SOA record in the domain name specified in the
      `dnssec.algorithmRolloverZone` input parameter. The domain may be present
      anywhere in the DNS hierarchy (that is, it does not need to be a TLD), but
      MUST have a secure chain of trust up to the root zone, so that it can be
      validated using the root zone trust anchor.

      During the test period (currently defined as 72 hours) the operator MUST
      successfully carry out an algorithm rollover for the domain (including an
      update to the DS record in the parent zone), where the algorithm used to
      secure the domain is changed, without disrupting the chain of trust.

      Note that the specific algorithms being rolled to and from are not
      significant (although they must be present in the IANA registry); it is
      not required that the new algorithm be more "secure" than the original
      algorithm; only that they are different. So a rollover from algorithm 13
      (`ECDSAP256SHA256`) to algorithm 8 (`RSASHA256`) will be accepted as well
      as a rollover from `RSASHA256` to `ECDSAP256SHA256`.

      present in the repository, and (b) that the expected object properties are
      present and valid.

      The responses will confirm that:

        * the `<roid>` element is valid and contains a repository ID registered
          with IANA;
        * the `<crDate>` and `<exDate>` elements are present valid;
        * the `<crID>` and `<clID>` elements match the client ID used to create
          the domain.
        * DNSSEC information provided in the `<create>` command is present and
          correct.

    Summary: domain <transfer> command test
    Description: |
      This test will confirm that the client is able to initiate a domain
      transfer.

      The client will perform an `<update>` command to set the authInfo code for
      the test domain (taken from the set created in `epp-32`) to a
      randomly-determined value.

      Then, using a second set of credentials, the client will connect to the
      EPP server and authenticate, submit `<transfer>` commands, and validate
      the responses.

      This test will confirm that:

      * the server rejects a `<transfer>` command with an invalid authInfo code
      * the server rejects a command which would extend the domain's validity
        period more than 10 years into the future
      * the server accepts a `<transfer>` command with a valid authInfo code
        and period.

      Once the transfer request has been accepted, the sponsoring client will
      wait for a message to be received on the server's message queue, and will
      then approve the transfer.

      Once the gaining registrar has also received a message on the queue, the
      client will confirm that:

      * the domain is now under the sponsorship of the gaining registrar
      * the authInfo code has been reset by the server (if the server supports
        RFC9154).

      3.3.1 of RFC8334.

      For this test, it is assumed that the EPP server has been configured to
      use data (specifically the Domain Name Label List, as described in Section
      5.3.3.1 of RFC9361) from the TMCH test environment.

      The client will connect to the EPP server and will submit `<create>`
      commands, using domain names and SMD files present in the TMCH test
      environment.

      If the server supports Start Date sunrises, the fully-qualified domain
      name will be constructed using a label from the SMD file and the
      `zz--edsct` TLD (eg `example.zz-edsct`). The Server MUST respond with a
      1000 or 1001 result code, however, if the client receives a 2302 "object
      exists" result code, it will retry with a different domain name.

      The client will also attempt to create a domain using an invalid SMD,
      which the server MUST reject.

      If the server supports End Date sunrises, the fully-qualified domain
      name will be constructed using a label from the SMD file and the
      `zz-sdsct` TLD (eg `example.zz-sdsct`). The Server MUST respond with a
      1000 or 1001 result code.
