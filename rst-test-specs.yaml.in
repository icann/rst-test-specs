Preamble: |
  This file describes each test [plan](#test-plans), [suite](#test-suites) and
  [case](#test-cases) in the RST system, as well as the
  [input parameters](#input-parameters) required for each, relevant
  [resources](#resources), any inter-case dependencies, and the
  [errors](#errors) that might occur during testing.

  The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD",
  "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
  document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC
  2119](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc2119.html) when, and only when, they
  appear in all capitals, as shown here.

  # 2.1. Test plans

  An individual *Test Plan* addresses a particular scenario (for example, RSP
  evaluation or Pre-Delegation Testing). Each plan consists of one or more *test
  suites*, which in turn include one or more *test cases*.

  ## 2.1.1. Test plan types

  There are two types of test plan described in this document:

  * **Business as usual** plans, which are used as part of the lifecycle of a
    gTLD (Pre-Delegion Test, RSP/DNS RSP change Test, IDN Test, SRS Gateway
    Test)
  * **RSP evaluation** plans, which are used as part of the RSP evaluation
    program.

  # 2.2. Test suites

  A *Test Suite* is a collection of *test cases* with a common theme or subject
  matter, for example, Authoritative DNS or Registry Data Escrow.

  # 2.3. Test cases

  A *Test Case* describes a process for determining the conformance or
  acceptability of a certain element of the system.

  A test case consists of a *test procedure* which accepts zero or more **input
  parameters**, and generates one or more **test results**.

  ## 2.3.1. Input parameters

  All test cases require some information about the subject of the test, for
  example, service hostnames, credentials, and functional parameters. These
  *input parameters* may be shared across multiple test cases.

  ## 2.3.2. Test environments

  Each test plan indicates whether the test is to be carried out in the
  production environment, or whether a test, staging or OT&E environment may be
  used. In general, test plans which are designed for "business as usual" use
  during the lifecycle of a TLD **MUST** be carried out in the production
  registry infrastructure, while RSP evaluation tests **MAY** be carried out in
  test, staging or OT&E environments.

  ## 2.3.3. Test results

  Test cases will generate one or more *test results*. Test results indicate the
  outcome of the test and other relevant information.

  ## 2.3.4. General pass/fail criteria

  In general, for a test to pass, **all** the test cases specified in the test
  suite(s) for the test plan **MUST** pass: if *any* fail, then the test as a
  whole will fail.

  A test case will fail if it produces one or more [errors](#errors) with the
  `ERROR` or `CRITICAL` severities.

  ## 2.3.5. Error severity levels

  1. `INFO` - an informational message.
  1. `NOTICE` - a normal but significant condition.
  2. `WARNING` - an issue which does not prevent the test from *passing*, but
     which may benefit from further investigation.
  1. `ERROR` - an issue which prevents the test from *passing*, but does not
     prevent the test from *continuing*. A test may produce multiple `ERROR`
     results.
  2. `CRITICAL` - an issue which prevents the test from continuing any
     further. A test will only produce a single `CRITICAL` result and it
     will always be the last result in the log.

  ## 2.3.6. Common errors

  For each test case, various errors and critical errors are defined which will
  be used to signal why that the case might have failed.

  In addition to these, there are a number of errors which any test case may
  produce, which are:

  * [TBA]

  SRSGatewayTest:
    Order: 6
    Name: SRS Gateway Test
    Description: |
      An SRS Gateway service is a Shared Registry System implementation that
      acts as a proxy between a subset of Registrars and the Registry. It uses
      a local cache to speed up EPP query commands, but forwards all EPP
      transform commands to the primary registry system. TLD registries need to
      deploy a proxy setup in order to operate in certain markets worldwide.

      The purpose of an SRS Gateway Test is to verify that the Registry
      Operator’s proxy setup operates in accordance with the technical and
      operational criteria for EPP systems described in the gTLD Applicant
      Guidebook (AGB). Furthermore, it **MUST** keep its own database
      synchronized with that of the TLD registry.

      The SRS Gateway Test Change Test uses the SRS gateway test suite only.

    Name: SRS Gateway RSP Evaluation Test
    Description: |
      SRS Gateway RSPs provide a proxy between a subset of Registrars and the
      Registry. It uses a local cache to speed up EPP query commands, but
      forwards all EPP transform commands to the primary registry system. TLD
      registries need to deploy a proxy setup in order to operate in certain
      markets worldwide.

      The [SRS Gateway test suite](#Test-Suite-StandardSRSGateway) requires
      access to a primary registry system that is logically independent of the
      SRS Gateway system, and details of the primary registry system are
      required as input parameters. RSPs wishing to offer SRS gateway services
      **MUST** identify such a primary registry system, which **MUST** be
      independent of the SRS gateway system, and MAY be operated by a third
      party.

  dnssec-91:
    Summary: Permitted signing algorithms
    Maturity: BETA
    Description: |
      In addition to the requirements outlined in `dnssec-05`, this test imposes
      an additional requirement on the signing algorithms used to sign zones,
      specifically, the algorithm number **MUST NOT** be lower than 8.
    Input-Parameters:
    Errors:
      - DNSSEC_DNS_QUERY_ERROR
      - DNSSEC_INVALID_SIGNING_ALGORITHM
    Dependencies:
      - dnssec-05
  dnssec-92:
    Summary: Permitted DS record hash algorithm(s)
    Maturity: BETA
    Description: |
      The DS record(s) submitted in the `dnssec.dsRecords` input parameters will
      be validated. Algorithm 1 (SHA-1) **MUST NOT** be used.

  dnssecOps01-ZSKRollover:
    Summary: ZSK rollover
    Description: |
      This test case verifies the RSP's ability to perform a ZSK rollover (as
      described in [Section 4.1.1 of
      RFC 6781](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6781#section-4.1.1) for
      a zone.

      If the value of the `dnssecOps.csk` input parameter is `true`, then this
      test will be skipped.

      The system will monitor the SOA record in the domain name specified in the
      `dnssec.zskRolloverZone` input parameter. The domain may be present
      anywhere in the DNS hierarchy (that is, it does not need to be a TLD), but
      **MUST** have a secure chain of trust up to the root zone, so that it can
      be validated using the root zone trust anchor.

      During the test period (currently defined as 24 hours) the operator
      **MUST** successfully carry out a ZSK rollover for the domain, where the
      Zone Signing Key is replaced, without disrupting the chain of trust.

      To simplify testing, applicants may wish to provision domain that is
      configured with short TTLs and a short ZSK lifetime, so that a ZSK
      rollover is guaranteed to occur within the 24 test period.
    Input-Parameters:
      - dnssecOps.csk
      - dnssecOps.zskRolloverZone
    Dependencies:
  dnssecOps02-KSKRollover:
    Summary: KSK rollover
    Description: |
      This test case verifies the RSP's ability to perform a CSK/KSK rollover
      (as described in [Sections 4.1.2 and 4.13 of
      RFC 6781](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6781#section-4.1.2) for
      a zone.

      The system will monitor the SOA record in the domain name specified in the
      `dnssec.kskRolloverZone` input parameter. The domain may be present
      anywhere in the DNS hierarchy (that is, it does not need to be a TLD), but
      **MUST** have a secure chain of trust up to the root zone, so that it can
      be validated using the root zone trust anchor.

      During the test period (currently defined as 24 hours) the operator
      **MUST** successfully carry out a KSK rollover for the domain, where the
      Key Signing Key is replaced, and the DS record in the parent zone is
      updated, without disrupting the chain of trust.
    Input-Parameters:
      - dnssecOps.kskRolloverZone
    Dependencies:
  dnssecOps03-AlgorithmRollover:
    Summary: algorithm rollover
    Description: |
      This test case verifies the RSP's ability to perform an algorithm rollover
      (as described in [Section 4.1.4 of
      RFC 6781](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6781#section-4.1.2) for
      a zone.

      The system will monitor the SOA record in the domain name specified in the
      `dnssec.algorithmRolloverZone` input parameter. The domain may be present
      anywhere in the DNS hierarchy (that is, it does not need to be a TLD), but
      **MUST** have a secure chain of trust up to the root zone, so that it can
      be validated using the root zone trust anchor.

      During the test period (currently defined as 72 hours) the operator
      **MUST** successfully carry out an algorithm rollover for the domain
      (including an update to the DS record in the parent zone), where the
      algorithm used to secure the domain is changed, without disrupting the
      chain of trust.

      Note that the specific algorithms being rolled to and from are not
      significant (although they **MUST** be present in the IANA registry); it
      is not required that the new algorithm be more "secure" than the original
      algorithm; only that they are different. So a rollover from algorithm 13
      (`ECDSAP256SHA256`) to algorithm 8 (`RSASHA256`) will be accepted as well
      as a rollover from `RSASHA256` to `ECDSAP256SHA256`.

      6. To ensure that the connection can be trusted, all service ports
         **MUST** present a certificate issued by a trusted CA, such as those
         supported by major browsers.
      7. All TLS certificates **MUST NOT** have expired, and **MUST** be
         presented wth any required intermediate certificates.
      8. The EPP server name **MUST** match at least one `subjectAltName` field
         in all presented certificates (either exact match or wildcard).
      9. Service ports **MUST** use at least one of the ciphers recommended in
         RFC 9325 (or any successor document).

         namespace URIs that are appropriate. The only mandatory URI that
         **MUST** be present is the domain namespace URI. The host and contact
         namespace URIs may be required depending on the `epp.hostModel` and
         `general.minimalPublicDataSet` parameters.
      6. All `<extURI>` element(s) in the `<greeting>` **MUST** contain XML
         namespace URIs that have been registered in the IANA registry, and that
         the mandatory extensions are also included.

      This test attempts to create a number of contact objects, and validates
      the server's response. For example, the test will expect that the server
      will reject a command that creates an object with missing or invalid
      properties, but will accept a command to create an object with valid
      properties. Property values will be randomly generated but will contain
      realistic values. No personal information will be transmitted as part
      of this test.

      If the `general.minimalPublicDataSet` input parameter is `true`, this
      test will be skipped.

      The test will confirm that the server checks and validates the values of
      the following elements:

      * `<contact:id>`
      * `<contact:status>`
      * `<contact:postalInfo>` element(s)
      * `<contact:name>` element
      * `<contact:cc>` element
      * `<contact:voice>`
      * `<contact:email>`

      * The server **MUST NOT** accept a `<contact:id>` element that
        contains a value that is not a valid `clIDType` value;
      * The server **MUST NOT** accept a `<contact:status>` element that
        contains a status code not defined in RFC 5733;
      * The server **MUST NOT** accept a `<contact:postalInfo>` element that
        contains a `type` attribute that is neither `int` nor `loc`;
      * The server **MUST NOT** accept a `<contact:cc>` element that contains a
        value that is not a valid ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 code;
      * The server **MUST NOT** accept a `<contact:voice>` element that contains
        a value that does not conform to the format described in Section 2.5 of
        RFC5733;
      * The server **MUST NOT** accept a `<contact:email>` element that contains
        a value that does not conform to the format specified in RFC 5322.

      Once objects have been created, the client will then perform `<info>`
      commands to verify that the server has correctly stored the provided
      values.

      be skipped.

      The client will perform `<update>` commands on the objects created during
      `epp-11` and will confirm that the server correctly accepts or rejects the
      commands, for example:

      * an `<update>` command which specifies a syntatically invalid host name
        is rejected;
      * an `<update>` command which places the object out-of-bailiwick is
        accepted;
      * an `<update>` command which places the object within a non-existent
        domain is rejected;
      * an `<update>` command which places the object within a domain sponsored
        by another registrar is rejected. The domain name(s) provided in the
        `epp.registeredNames` parameter will be used for this test.
      * an `<update>` command which places the object within a domain sponsored
        by the test client is accepted. **TODO: what will the parent domain
        be?**

      The client will then perform `<info>` commands on the objects successfully
      updated, to confirm that the server has correctly stored the updated

    Summary: domain <create> command test
    Description: |
      This test performs a series domain `<create>` commands, using pseudo-
      random ASCII domain names under each TLD in the TLD set. If the
      `general.minimalPublicDataSet` input parameter is `false` then a contact
      object (containing pseudo-random contact information) will be created
      beforehand and used as the registrant. If the `epp.hostModel` parameter is
      `objects`, then two host objects with pseudo-random names will be created
      and used as the nameservers (otherwise the names will be provided as
      attributes).

      The client will perform several `<create>` commands, each of which will
      test certain aspects of the server's processing of those commands, for
      example:

        * to confirm that the server does not accept invalid values for object
          properties (such as domain name, registration period, registant ID,
          nameservers, DS record parameters, etc) **TODO: what is "etc"?**
          examples:
            * invalid domain
            * invalid period (1-10 years)
            * non-existent registrant
            * non-existent hosts
            * invalid DS/keyData record parameters
        * to confirm that the server does not accept commands which reference
          non-existent host/contact objects
        * to confirm the server supports all permitted client-assigned status
          codes
        * to confirm that the server rejects a `<create>` command which
          specifies a registrant contact (where the
          `general.minimalPublicDataSet` input parameter is `true`)
        * to confirm that the server rejects a `<create>` command which does not
          specify a registrant contact (where the
          `general.minimalPublicDataSet`) input parameter is `false`
        * to confirm that the server rejects a `<create>` command containing
          host objects when the `epp.hostModel` parameter is `attributes`
        * to confirm that the server rejects a `<create>` command containing
          host attributes when the `epp.hostModel` parameter is `objects`
        * to confirm that the the server which implements RFC 9154 accepts a
          `<create>` command without an authInfo command.

    Description: |
      This test performs a series of `<info>` commands on the domain objects
      created in `epp-16`. This test checks that (a) the domain names are
      present in the repository, and (b) that the expected object properties are
      present and valid.

      The responses will confirm that:

        * the `<roid>` element is valid and contains a repository ID registered
          with IANA;
        * the `<crDate>` and `<exDate>` elements are present valid;
        * the `<crID>` and `<clID>` elements match the client ID used to create
          the domain.

        * Following a succesful `<renew>` command, the expiry date of the domain
          **MUST** have been increased by the period specified by the client;
        * Where a server supports RFC 3915, the domain **MUST** have an RGP
          status of `renewPeriod`;
        * The server **MUST** reject a `<renew>` command if it would result in
          the expiry date being more than 10 years into the future.

    Summary: domain <transfer> command test
    Description: |
      This test will confirm that the client is able to initiate a domain
      transfer.

      The client will perform an `<update>` command to set the authInfo code for
      the test domain (taken from the set created in `epp-16`) to a
      randomly-determined value. If the server implements RFC 9154, it **MUST**
      reject the `<update>` command if the authInfo code is insufficently
      secure.

      Then, using a second set of credentials, the client will connect to the
      EPP server and authenticate, submit `<transfer>` commands, and validate
      the responses.

      This test will confirm that:

      * the server rejects a `<transfer>` command with an invalid authInfo code
      * the server rejects a command which would extend the domain's validity
        period more than 10 years into the future
      * the server accepts a `<transfer>` command with a valid authInfo code
        and period.

      Once the transfer request has been accepted, the sponsoring client will
      wait for a message to be received on the server's message queue, and will
      then approve the transfer.

      **TODO: make implicit info explicit**
      Once the gaining registrar has also received a message on the queue, the
      client will confirm that:

      * the domain is now under the sponsorship of the gaining registrar
      * the authInfo code has been reset by the server (if the server supports
        RFC 9154).

      Sunrise domain/launch application <create> command test
    Description: |
      This test is used to confirm the conformance of the EPP server's
      implementation of the Sunrise Create Form, as described in Section
      3.3.1 of RFC 8334.

      For this test, it is assumed that the EPP server has been configured to
      use data (specifically the Domain Name Label List, as described in Section
      5.3.3.1 of RFC 9361) from the TMCH test environment.

      The client will connect to the EPP server and will submit `<create>`
      commands, using domain names and SMD files present in the TMCH test
      environment.

      If the server supports Start Date sunrises, the fully-qualified domain
      name will be constructed using a label from the SMD file and the
      `minimumRPMS.sunriseTLD` input parameter. The Server **MUST** respond with
      a 1000 or 1001 result code, however, if the client receives a 2302 "object
      exists" result code, it will retry with a different domain name.

      The client will also attempt to create a domain using an invalid SMD,
      which the server **MUST** reject.

      If the server supports End Date sunrises, the fully-qualified domain
      name will be constructed using a label from the SMD file and the
      `minimumRPMS.sunriseTLD` input parameter. The Server **MUST** respond with
      a 1000 or 1001 result code.

      The client will also attempt to create a domain using an invalid SMD,
      which the server **MUST** reject.

      **TODO: test create with revoked certificate**
      **TODO: test create with revoked SMD**

      If the server supports both modes, then both of the above tests will be
      performed.

      5.3.3.1 of RFC 9361) from the TMCH test environment.

      The client will connect to the EPP server and will submit `<create>`
      commands, using domain names present in the TMCH test environment.

      The domain name will be constructed using a label from the DNL, and the
      `minimumRPMS.claimsTLD` input parameter. The client will perform a
      Trademark Claims `<check>` command beforehand to obtain the claim key, and
      will then synthesise a trademark claims acknowledgement. The server
      **MUST** respond with a 1000 or 10001 response.

      The client will also perform `<create>` command using an invalid
      claims acknowledgements **TODO: (invalid claim key, expiry date, see RFC
      9361)**. The server **MUST** respond with a 2xxx error.

      **TODO: do info afterwards**
