  Description: |
    This test confirms that the SRS Gateway EPP system is reachable over IPv4
    and IPv6.

    The SRS Gateway EPP server host name will be resolved to obtain its
    IPv4 and IPv6 addresses. The client will then attempt to connect to TCP
    port 700 on these addresses and log in using the provided credentials.

    The client will connect to the SRS Gateway EPP system, authenticate, and
    submit a `<create>` command for a pseudo-randomly generated host name.
    IP address information will be provided if required. The server **MUST**
    respond with a 1000 or 1001 response. The client will then perform an
    `<info>` command and will capture the response.

    It will then connect to the primary EPP system, authenticate, and perform
    an `<info>` command for the object created in the first step. If the
    server responds with a 2303 response, it will wait for 30 seconds and
