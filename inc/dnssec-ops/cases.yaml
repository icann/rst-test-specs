dnssecOps01-ZSKRollover:
  Implemented: false
  Summary: ZSK rollover
  Maturity: GAMMA
  Description: |
    This test case verifies the RSP's ability to perform a ZSK rollover (as
    described in [Section 4.1.1 of
    RFC 6781](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc6781.html#section-4.1.1)).

    If the value of the `dnssecOps.csk` input parameter is `true`, then this
    test will be skipped.

    The system will monitor the zone specified in the `dnssec.zskRolloverZone`
    input parameter. The domain may be present anywhere in the global DNS
    hierarchy (that is, it does not need to be a TLD), but **MUST** have a
    secure chain of trust up to the root zone, so that it can be validated using
    the root zone trust anchor.

    The zone **MUST** contain at least 10,000 delegations, where a delegation is
    considered to be one or more `NS` records with owner names that are below
    the zone's origin. If NSEC3 is used for secure denial of existence, the
    opt-out flag `MUST NOT` be set *(that is, an `RRSIG` record should be
    present for all `NS` rrsets, irrespective of whether a corresponding `DS`
    record is published)*.

    Monitoring will be carried out using `SOA` queries sent to multiple
    validating DNS resolvers, and by validating the result of a zone transfer
    from the server(s) specified in the `dnssecOps.primaryServers` input
    parameter.

    During the test period (currently defined as 48 hours) the operator
    **MUST** successfully carry out a ZSK rollover for the domain, where the
    Zone Signing Key is replaced, without disrupting the chain of trust.

    The original ZSK **MUST** additionally be unpublished (removed from the
    zone) before the end of the test period.

    To simplify testing, applicants may wish to provision the zone such that it
    is configured with short TTLs and a short ZSK lifetime, so that a ZSK
    rollover is guaranteed to occur within the 48 test period.

dnssecOps02-KSKRollover:
  Implemented: false
  Summary: KSK rollover
  Maturity: GAMMA
  Description: |
    This test case verifies the RSP's ability to perform a CSK/KSK rollover
    (as described in [Sections 4.1.2 and 4.13 of
    RFC 6781](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc6781.html#section-4.1.2)).

    The system will monitor the zone specified in the `dnssec.kskRolloverZone`
    input parameter. The domain may be present anywhere in the global DNS
    hierarchy (that is, it does not need to be a TLD), but **MUST** have a
    secure chain of trust up to the root zone, so that it can be validated using
    the root zone trust anchor.

    The zone **MUST** contain at least 10,000 delegations, where a delegation is
    considered to be one or more `NS` records with owner names that are below
    the zone's origin. If NSEC3 is used for secure denial of existence, the
    opt-out flag `MUST NOT` be set *(that is, an `RRSIG` record should be
    present for all `NS` rrsets, irrespective of whether a corresponding `DS`
    record is published)*.

    Monitoring will be carried out using `SOA` queries sent to multiple
    validating DNS resolvers, and by validating the result of a zone transfer
    from the server(s) specified in the `dnssecOps.primaryServers` input
    parameter.

    During the test period (currently defined as 48 hours) the operator
    **MUST** successfully carry out a KSK rollover for the domain, where the
    Key Signing Key is replaced, and the DS record in the parent zone is
    updated, without disrupting the chain of trust.

    The DS record for the original KSK **MUST** additionally be removed from the
    parent zone before the end of the test period.

    To simplify testing, applicants may wish to use a subdomain of
    an existing DNSSEC-signed zone under their control, so that completion of
    the test is not dependent on interaction with a third party.
  Input-Parameters:
    - dnssecOps.kskRolloverZone
  Errors:
    - DNSSEC_OPS_DNS_QUERY_FAILED_TOO_MANY_TIMES
    - DNSSEC_OPS_XFR_FAILED_TOO_MANY_TIMES

dnssecOps03-AlgorithmRollover:
  Implemented: false
  Summary: algorithm rollover
  Maturity: GAMMA
  Description: |
    This test case verifies the RSP's ability to perform an algorithm rollover
    (as described in [Section 4.1.4 of
    RFC 6781](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc6781.html#section-4.1.2)).

    The system will monitor the zone specified in the `dnssec.algorithmRolloverZone`
    input parameter. The domain may be present anywhere in the global DNS
    hierarchy (that is, it does not need to be a TLD), but **MUST** have a
    secure chain of trust up to the root zone, so that it can be validated using
    the root zone trust anchor.

    The zone **MUST** contain at least 10,000 delegations, where a delegation is
    considered to be one or more `NS` records with owner names that are below
    the zone's origin. If NSEC3 is used for secure denial of existence, the
    opt-out flag `MUST NOT` be set *(that is, an `RRSIG` record should be
    present for all `NS` rrsets, irrespective of whether a corresponding `DS`
    record is published)*.

    Monitoring will be carried out using `SOA` queries sent to multiple
    validating DNS resolvers, and by validating the result of a zone transfer
    from the server(s) specified in the `dnssecOps.primaryServesr` input
    parameter.

    During the test period (currently defined as 48 hours) the operator
    **MUST** successfully carry out an algorithm rollover for the domain
    (including an update to the DS record in the parent zone), where the
    algorithm used to secure the domain is changed, without disrupting the
    chain of trust.

    The DS record for the original KSK **MUST** additionally be removed from the
    parent zone before the end of the test period.

    Note that the specific algorithms being rolled to and from are not
    significant (although they **MUST** be present in the IANA registry and
    comply with all other requirements specified in the DNSSEC test suite); it
    is not required that the new algorithm be more "secure" than the original
    algorithm; only that they are different. So for example, a rollover from
    algorithm 13 (`ECDSAP256SHA256`) to algorithm 8 (`RSASHA256`) will be
    accepted as well as a rollover from `RSASHA256` to `ECDSAP256SHA256`.

    To simplify testing, applicants may wish to use a subdomain of
    an existing DNSSEC-signed zone under their control, so that completion of
    the test is not dependent on interaction with a third party.
  Input-Parameters:
    - dnssecOps.algorithmRolloverZone
