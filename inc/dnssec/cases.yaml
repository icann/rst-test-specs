dnssec-91:
  Summary: Permitted signing algorithms
  Maturity: GAMMA
  Description: |
    In addition to the requirements outlined in `dnssec-05`, this test imposes
    an additional requirement on the signing algorithms used to sign zones.

    Specifically, the algorithm number **MUST NOT** be lower than 8.
  Errors:
    - DNSSEC_DNS_QUERY_ERROR
    - DNSSEC_INVALID_SIGNING_ALGORITHM

dnssec-92:
  Summary: Permitted DS record hash algorithm(s)
  Maturity: GAMMA
  Description: |
    The DS record(s) submitted in the `dnssec.dsRecords` input parameter will
    be validated. Algorithm 1 (SHA-1) **MUST NOT** be used.
  Errors:
    - DNSSEC_DNS_QUERY_ERROR
    - DNSSEC_INVALID_DIGEST_ALGORITHM

dnssec-93:
  Summary: NSEC3 iterations check
  Description: |
    [RFC 9276](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9276.html) defines best
    practice relating to the use of NSEC3 for Authenticated Denial of Existence.
    This test case verifies that the zone's NSEC3 configuration complies with
    this best practice.

    If the zone does not use NSEC3, then this test will be skipped.

    The `NSEC3PARAM` record will be checked to ensure that:

    * the value of the `iterations` field of the NSEC3 record is zero;
    * the value of the `salt` field of the NSEC3 record is empty (represented as
      a `-` in the presentation format).
  Errors:
    - DNSSEC_DNS_QUERY_ERROR
    - DNSSEC_NSEC3_ITERATIONS_IS_NOT_ZERO
    - DNSSEC_NSEC3_SALT_IS_NOT_EMPTY
