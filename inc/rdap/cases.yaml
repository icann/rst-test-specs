rdap-91:
  Summary: TLS version conformance check
  Maturity: GAMMA
  Description: |
    **NOTE: this test case is a placeholder for a test case that will eventually
    be added to the RDAP Conformance Tool.**

    This test case verifies that the RDAP server properly implements a secure
    TLS configuration.

    1. All service ports **MUST** support TLSv1.2 and optionally any subsequent
       protocol published by the IETF.
    2. TLSv1.1 and all previous versions have known security issues and **MUST
       NOT** be supported by any service ports.
    3. To ensure that the connection can be trusted, all service ports
       **MUST** present a certificate issued by a trusted CA, such as those
       supported by major browsers (see the `epp.tlsCertificateStore` resource).
    4. All TLS certificates **MUST NOT** have expired, and **MUST** be
       presented wth any required intermediate certificates.
    5. The RDAP server name **MUST** match at least one `subjectAltName` field
       in all presented certificates (either exact match or wildcard).
    6. Service ports **MUST** use at least one of the ciphers recommended in
       RFC 9325 (or any successor document).

rdap-92:
  Summary: Service port consistency check
  Maturity: GAMMA
  Description: |
    **NOTE: this test case is a placeholder for a test case that will eventually
    be added to the RDAP Conformance Tool.**

    This test confirms that all RDAP service ports return identical responses.

    Since applicants must provide an RDAP service over both IPv4 and IPv6, at
    least two service ports will be checked.

    The client will establish separate connections to each RDAP service port
    (defined as an IP address and TCP port, where at least one IPv4 address/port
    pair and IPv6 address/port pair are expected) and perform RDAP queries on
    the objects specified in the `rdap.testDomains`, `rdap.testEntities`, and
    `rdap.testNameservers` input parameters.

    The responses returned by each service port **MUST**, with the exception
    of the `last update of RDAP database` event, be consistent, once the JSON
    body has been parsed and canonicalised.
  Errors:
    - RDAP_TLS_DNS_RESOLUTION_ERROR
    - RDAP_TLS_SERVICE_PORT_UNREACHABLE
    - RDAP_TLS_NO_SERVICE_PORTS_REACHABLE
    - RDAP_SERVICE_PORT_NOT_CONSISTENT
