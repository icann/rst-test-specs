  Summary: Label validation test
  Maturity: GAMMA
  Description: |
    This test confirms that the EPP server correctly accepts or rejects domain
    `<create>` commands for valid and invalid IDN labels, respectively.

    If there are no IDN tables supported under any of the TLDs associated with
    the test, then this test will be skipped.

    For each supported IDN table, the test client will perform a series of
    `<create>` commands using a pre-defined catalogue of test labels. If
    required, the client will create any contact object(s) needed.

    The server **MUST** reject all `<create>` commands for invalid labels and
    **MUST** accept all `<create>` commands for valid labels.
  Errors:
    - EPP_DNS_RESOLUTION_ERROR
    - EPP_SERVICE_PORT_UNREACHABLE
    - EPP_NO_SERVICE_PORTS_REACHABLE
    - EPP_TLS_CONNECTION_ERROR
    - EPP_XML_PARSE_ERROR

  Summary: Level 1 variant handling test
  Maturity: GAMMA
  Description: |
    This test confirms the EPP server's conformance with the Level 1 variant
    support (no support for variant activation, all variants are blocked).

    If there are no IDN tables for which Level 1 support is claimed, this
    test will be skipped.

    For each supported IDN table, the test client will perform a series of
    `<create>` commands using a pre-defined catalogue of test labels. If
    required, the client will create any contact object(s) needed.

    The client will then submit `<create>` commands for one or more labels
    that are variants of the names created in the first step. The server
    **MUST** reject these commands.
  Errors:
    - EPP_DNS_RESOLUTION_ERROR
    - EPP_SERVICE_PORT_UNREACHABLE
    - EPP_NO_SERVICE_PORTS_REACHABLE
    - EPP_TLS_CONNECTION_ERROR
    - EPP_XML_PARSE_ERROR
    - EPP_SCHEMA_VALIDATION_ERROR
    - EPP_LOGIN_ERROR
    - IDN_VARIANT_LABEL_NOT_BLOCKED

idn-03:
  Summary: Level 2 variant handling test
  Maturity: GAMMA
  Description: |
    This test confirms the EPP server's conformance with the Level 2 variant
    support (variants are supported within the same TLD).

    If there are no IDN tables for which Level 2 support is claimed, this
    test will be skipped.

    For each supported IDN table, the test client will perform a series of
    `<create>` commands using a pre-defined catalogue of test labels. If
    required, the client will create any contact object(s) needed.

    The client will then submit `<create>` commands for one or more labels
    that are variants of the names created in the first step. Some of these
    commands will be made using the same registrar account as the first step,
    while some will be made using alternate credentials. If the value of the
    `general.registryDataModel` input parameter is `maximum` or `per-registrar`,
    then some commands will also use a different registrant contact.

    The server **MUST** reject `<create>` commands where the (a) registrar is
    different from that of the primary label or (b) the registrant (if
    applicable) is different.
  Errors:
    - EPP_DNS_RESOLUTION_ERROR
    - EPP_SERVICE_PORT_UNREACHABLE
    - EPP_NO_SERVICE_PORTS_REACHABLE
    - EPP_TLS_CONNECTION_ERROR
    - EPP_XML_PARSE_ERROR

idn-04:
  Summary: Level 3 variant handling test
  Maturity: GAMMA
  Description: |
    This test confirms the EPP server's conformance with the Level 3 variant
    support (variants are supported within variant TLD(s)).

    If there are no IDN tables for which Level 3 support is claimed, this
    test will be skipped.

    For each supported IDN table, the test client will perform a series of
    `<create>` commands using a pre-defined catalogue of test labels. If
    required, the client will create any contact object(s) needed.

    The client will then submit `<create>` commands for one or more labels
    that are variants (at both second- and top-level) of the names created in
    the first step. Some of these commands will be made using the same
    registrar account as the first step, while some will be made using
    alternate credentials. If the value of the `general.registryDataModel`
    input parameter is `maximum` or `per-registrar`, then some commands will
    also use a different registrant contact.

    The server **MUST** reject `<create>` commands where the (a) registrar is
    different from that of the primary label or (b) the registrant (if
    applicable) is different.

  Summary: ASCII domains in IDN-only TLD test
  Maturity: BETA
  Description: |
    This test confirms that the EPP server rejects EPP `<create>` commands for
    a domain under a TLD that is configured to be "IDN only" (that is, pure
    ASCII domains are not permitted).

    If all TLDs in the test have `idnOnly` properties that are `false`, this
    test will be skipped.

    For those TLDs for which the `idnOnly` property is `true`, an EPP `<create>`
    command will be sent to the EPP server for a domain name that is
    syntactically valid, comprised only of characters from the LDH ASCII range,
    and not already registered.

    The EPP server **MUST** reject the command.
  Errors:
    - EPP_DNS_RESOLUTION_ERROR
    - EPP_SERVICE_PORT_UNREACHABLE
    - EPP_NO_SERVICE_PORTS_REACHABLE
    - EPP_TLS_CONNECTION_ERROR
    - EPP_XML_PARSE_ERROR

idn-06:
  Summary: IDNA2008 conformance test
  Maturity: BETA
  Description: |
    This test confirms that the EPP server rejects EPP `<create>` commands for
    domains that do not conform to the requirements of IDNA2008 (but which may
    be valid in IDNA2003).

    EPP `<create>` commands will be sent to the server for a variety of
    pre-generated test labels. The server **MUST** reject all these commands.
  Errors:
    - EPP_DNS_RESOLUTION_ERROR
    - EPP_SERVICE_PORT_UNREACHABLE
    - EPP_NO_SERVICE_PORTS_REACHABLE
    - EPP_TLS_CONNECTION_ERROR
    - EPP_XML_PARSE_ERROR
