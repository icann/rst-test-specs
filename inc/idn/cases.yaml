  Summary: IDN label validation test
  Maturity: BETA
  Description: |
    This test case validates that the EPP server correctly validates IDN domains
    during the EPP `<create>` process and applies the applicable rules in
    relation to handling of variants.

    Using the TLD(s) to which the test relates, and the sets of allocatable and
    unallocatable test labels associated with the IDN tables specified for those
    TLDs, a set of valid and invalid domain names will be generated.

    The test client will then connect to the EPP server, and perform `<create>`
    commands for each domain, checking to confirm that the EPP server correctly
    accepts or rejects the command, as applicable.

    Where a variant policy is applicable (which is determined by both the IDN
    table and the policy specified for the TLD), and variant domains are
    generated, The client will also ensure that the EPP server properly
    implements that policy: that is, variant domains must (a) be blocked, or (b)
    only be available for registration by (i) the same registrant, or (ii) if
    the TLD uses the minimal public data set, the same registrar.

  Summary: ASCII domains in IDN-only TLD test
  Maturity: BETA
  Description: |
    This test confirms that the EPP server rejects EPP `<create>` commands for
    a domain under TLDs that are configured to be "IDN only" (that is, pure
    ASCII domains are not permitted).

    If all TLDs in the test have `idnOnly` properties that are `false`, this
    test will be skipped.

    For those TLDs for which the `idnOnly` property is `true`, an EPP `<create>`
    command will be sent to the EPP server for a domain name that is
    syntactically valid, comprised only of characters from the LDH ASCII range,
    and not already registered.

    The EPP server **MUST** reject the command.
  Errors:
    - EPP_DNS_RESOLUTION_ERROR
    - EPP_SERVICE_PORT_UNREACHABLE
    - EPP_NO_SERVICE_PORTS_REACHABLE
    - EPP_TLS_CONNECTION_ERROR
