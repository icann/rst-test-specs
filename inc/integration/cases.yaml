  Summary: EPP -> RDAP Integration Test
  Maturity: GAMMA
  Description: |
    This test confirms that the EPP and RDAP systems are properly integrated,
    that is, that transform commands performed on objects in the EPP system
    are reflected in the RDAP system within the Service Level Requirement of
    the SLA.

    The test system will connect to the EPP server and create domain and (if
    applicable) host and contact objects using the same methodology as `epp-14`
    and `epp-11`. It will then perform RDAP queries for those objects.

    The RDAP server **MUST** provide a 200 response for every object created
    within 1 hour of the object's `<crDate>` element.
  Input-Parameters:
    - rdap.baseURLs

  Summary: EPP -> DNS Integration Test
  Maturity: GAMMA
  Description: |
    This test confirms that the EPP and DNS systems are properly integrated,
    that is, that transform commands performed on objects in the EPP system
    are reflected in the DNS within the Service Level Requirement of the SLA.

    The test system will connect to the EPP server and create domain and (if
    applicable) host and contact objects using the same methodology as
    `integration-01`.

    The test system will perform DNS queries to confirm that the DNS servers
    provide responses for the created domain names. All DNS servers **MUST**
    provide the correct DNS response for all domains within 1 hour of the
    domain's `<crDate>` element.
  Errors:
    - EPP_DNS_RESOLUTION_ERROR

  Summary: EPP -> RDE Integration Test
  Maturity: GAMMA
  Description: |
    This test confirms that the EPP and RDE systems are properly integrated,
    that is, that objects created in the EPP system are reflected in a valid
    RDE deposit file within the Service Level Requirement of the SLA.

    The test system will connect to the EPP server and create domain and (if
    applicable) host and contact objects using the same methodology as
    `integration-01`.

    The test system will periodically connect to the SFTP server specified by
    the `integration.rdeSFTPHostname` input parameter, using the username
    specified in the `integration.rdeSFTPUsername` input parameter and the SSH
    key in the `integration.rdeSFTPPublicKey` resource, and look for .ryde
    files in the directory specified by the `integration.rdeSFTPDirectory`
    input parameter. Note that operators **MUST** ensure that the IP addresses
    listed in the `integration.rdeSFTPACL` resource have been added to the
    Access Control List for the SFTP server (if any).

    All objects created **MUST** be found in a RDE deposit file within 24 hours
    of each object's `<crDate>` element.
  Resources:
    - integration.rdeSFTPPublicKey
    - integration.rdeSFTPACL
  Input-Parameters:
    - integration.rdeSFTPHostname
    - integration.rdeSFTPDirectory
    - integration.rdeSFTPUsername

  Summary: Glue policy verification (host objects)
  Description: |
    This test case verifies that the registry system correctly implements the
    specified glue policy, for EPP servers that use host objects.

    This test case will be skipped unless the value of the `dns.gluePolicy`
    input parameter is `narrow` and the value of the `epp.hostModel` input
    parameter is `objects`.

    The test client will connect to the EPP server, authenticate, and then
    create a domain name.

    It will then create three internal host objects that are subordinate to the
    previously created domain name, each with different IP addresses.

    The client will then submit an `<update>` command to assign two of the three
    host objects to the domain, but not the third.

    Then, the DNS servers specified in the `dns.nameservers` will be monitored
    by sending periodic A/AAAA DNS queries for host names previously described.

    Within 60 minutes of the completion of the `<update>` command described
    above, the A/AAAA record(s) for the two host objects assigned to the domain
    **MUST** be observed in DNS query responses. The A/AAAA record(s) for the
    unlinked host object **MUST NOT** be observed in DNS query responses
  Errors:
    - EPP_DNS_RESOLUTION_ERROR
    - EPP_SERVICE_PORT_UNREACHABLE
    - EPP_NO_SERVICE_PORTS_REACHABLE
    - EPP_TLS_CONNECTION_ERROR

  Summary: Glue policy verification (host attributes)
  Description: |
    This test case verifies that the registry system correctly implements the
    specified glue policy, for EPP servers that use host attributes.

    This test case will be skipped unless the value of the `dns.gluePolicy`
    input parameter is `narrow` and the value of the `epp.hostModel` input
    parameter is `attributes`.

    The test client will connect to the EPP server, authenticate, and then
    create a domain name. The `<create>` command will include `<hostAttr>`
    elements for two names that are subordinate to the domain being created.
    Each `<hostAttr>` element will contain at least one `<hostAddr>` element.

    It will then reconnect using an alternate set of credentials, and attempt to
    create another domain name. The `<create>` command will include `<hostAttr>`
    elements for two names that are also subordinate to the previously created
    domain, with different names, and different IP addresses in the `<hostAddr>`
    element(s).

    Then, the DNS servers specified in the `dns.nameservers` will be monitored
    by sending periodic A/AAAA DNS queries for host names assigned to the two
    domain names.

    Within 60 minutes of the completion of the `<create>` command for that
    domain, the A/AAAA record(s) for the nameservers assigned to the first
    domain **MUST** be observed in DNS query responses. The A/AAAA record(s) for
    the nameservers assigned to the second domain **MUST NOT** be observed in
    DNS query responses.
