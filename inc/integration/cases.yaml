  Summary: EPP -> RDAP Integration Test
  Maturity: BETA
  Description: |
    This test confirms that the EPP and RDAP systems are properly integrated,
    that is, that transform commands performed on objects in the EPP system
    are reflected in the RDAP system within the Service Level Requirement of
    the SLA.

    The test system will connect to the EPP server and create domain and (if
    applicable) host and contact objects using the same methodology as `epp-14`
    `epp-11`. It will then perform RDAP queries for those objects.

    The RDAP server **MUST** provide a 200 response for every object created
    within 1 hour of the object's `<crDate>` element.
  Input-Parameters:
    - epp.hostName
    - epp.serverIssuedClientCertificate01
    - epp.clid01
    - epp.pwd01
    - epp.hostModel
    - rdap.baseURLs
  Errors:
    - EPP_DNS_RESOLUTION_ERROR
    - EPP_SERVICE_PORT_UNREACHABLE
    - EPP_TLS_CONNECTION_ERROR
    - EPP_LOGIN_ERROR
    - EPP_XML_PARSE_ERROR
    - EPP_GENERIC_COMMAND_ERROR
    - EPP_UNEXPECTED_COMMAND_FAILURE

  Summary: EPP -> DNS Integration Test
  Maturity: BETA
  Description: |
    This test confirms that the EPP and DNS systems are properly integrated,
    that is, that transform commands performed on objects in the EPP system
    are reflected in the RDAP system within the Service Level Requirement of
    the SLA.

    The test system will perform DNS queries to confirm that the DNS servers
    provide responses for the domain names created in `integration-01`. All DNS
    servers **MUST** provide the correct DNS response for all domains within 1
    hour of the domains's `<crDate>` element.
  Input-Parameters:
    - dns.nameservers
  Dependencies:
    - integration-01
  Errors:
    - INTEGRATION_DNS_QUERY_FAILED
    - INTEGRATION_DOMAIN_NOT_PRESENT_IN_DNS
    - INTEGRATION_DNS_ANSWER_IS_INCORRECT
integration-03:
  Summary: EPP -> RDE Integration Test
  Maturity: BETA
  Description: |
    This test confirms that the EPP and RDE systems are properly integrated,
    that is, that objects created in the EPP system are reflected in a valid
    RDE deposit file within the Service Level Requirement of the SLA.

    The test system will periodically connect to the SFTP server specified by
    the `integration.rdeSFTPHostname` input parameter, using the username
    specified in the `integration.rdeSFTPUsername` input parameter and the SSH
    key in the `integration.rdeSFTPPublicKey` resource, and look for .ryde
    files in the directory specified by the `integration.rdeSFTPDirectory`
    input parameter. Note that operators **MUST** ensure that the IP addresses
    listed in the `integration.rdeSFTPACL` resource have been added to the
    Access Control List for the SFTP server (if any).

    All objects created in the `integration-01` test case **MUST** be found
    within a valid RDE deposit file (that is, the deposit passes all the tests
    in the RDE test suite) within 24 hours of each object's `<crDate>` element.

    Furthermore, for each deposit found in the directory, the corresponding
    RDE report (as described in [Section 2.1 of
    draft-lozano-icann-registry-interfaces](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/draft-lozano-icann-registry-interfaces#section-2))
    **MUST** be recieved on the test RRI environment before 23:59:59 UTC on
    the date specified in the Watermark element of the deposit file.

    To facilitate submission of RDE reports, the RRI test environment will be
    configured to accept submissions for the TLDs associated with the test
    from clients using the same TLSA DNS hostnames that are configured for the
    test.
