#define BAU_PLAN_ENVIRONMENT_NOTE **Note on test environment:** this is a "business as usual" test, designed to test a soon-to-be or already delegated TLD. Therefore, all input parameters provided **MUST** relate to the production registry environment.

#define RSP_EVALUATION_ENVIRONMENT_NOTE **Note on test environment:** this test is designed to be used as part of the RSP evaluation program. Therefore, input parameters **MAY** be provided the relate to a test, staging or OT&E environment.

#define TP_PASSFAIL As with all other [test plans](#test-plans), for this test to pass, **all** the listed test cases **MUST** pass: if **any** fail, then the test as a whole will fail.

StandardPreDelegationTest:
  Order: 1
  Name: Pre-Delegation Test
  Description: |
    The purpose of the Pre-Delegation Test is to verify that the applicant has
    met its commitment to establish registry operations in accordance with the
    technical and operational criteria described in the gTLD Applicant Guidebook
    (AGB). Each applicant will be required to complete PDT as a prerequisite to
    delegation into the root zone.

    The Pre-Delegation Test covers all critical registry services and IDNs, and
    therefore uses all standard test suites.

StandardRSPChangeTest:

  Name: RSP Change Test
  Description: |
    A Registry Operator may apply to ICANN to change a Material Subcontracting
    Arrangement (MSA) and appoint a new Registry Services Provider. Before
    this change can be approved, the new RSP **MUST** complete Registry System
    Testing to ensure their systems comply with the technical and operational
    requirements of the Registry Agreement.

    The RSP Change Test covers all critical registry services and IDNs, and
    therefore uses all test standard suites.

DNSRSPChangeTest:

  Name: DNS RSP Change Test
  Description: |
    A Registry Operator may apply to ICANN to change a Material Subcontracting
    Arrangement (MSA) and appoint a new provider of authoritative DNS services
    instead of or in addition to any existing provider(s).

    Before this change can be approved, the new DNS provider **MUST** complete
    testing to ensure their systems comply with the technical and operational
    requirements of the Registry Agreement.

    The DNS RSP Change Test uses the DNS test suite only.

  Name: Standard IDN Test
  Description: |
    A Registry Operator may apply to ICANN to amend its Registry Agreement
    to offer new scripts and/or languages for Internationalized Domain Names.

    The purpose of an IDN RST test is to verify that the Registry Operator’s
    registry system handles IDN registrations in accordance with the
    submitted policy statements and IDN tables.

    The IDN Test uses the IDN test suite only.

RSPEvaluationIDNTest:
  Order: 5
  Name: IDN Test (RSP Evaluation)
  Description: |
    This test plan is identical to the Standard IDN Test, but is intended
    solely for use in the RSP evaluation program.

    One key difference between this plan and the Standard IDN Test is that the
    TLD string(s) that will be used will not be real (delegated or applied-for)
    TLDs but test TLDs that will be determined by ICANN. Test subjects will be
    required to configure their systems to support these TLDs prior to the start
    of the test run.

SRSGatewayTest:
  Order: 6
  Name: SRS Gateway Test
  Description: |
    An SRS Gateway service is a Shared Registry System implementation that acts
    as a proxy between a subset of Registrars and the Registry. It uses a local
    cache to speed up EPP query commands, but forwards all EPP transform
    commands to the primary registry system. TLD registries need to deploy a
    proxy setup in order to operate in certain markets worldwide.

    The purpose of an SRS Gateway Test is to verify that the Registry Operator’s
    proxy setup operates in accordance with the technical and operational
    criteria for EPP systems described in the gTLD Applicant Guidebook (AGB).
    Furthermore, it **MUST** keep its own database synchronized with that of the
    TLD registry.

    The SRS Gateway Test Change Test uses the SRS gateway test suite only.

MainRSPEvaluationTest:
  Order: 7
  Name: Main RSP Evaluation Test
  Description: |
    The Main RSP is responsible for the creation and maintenance of domain name
    registrations in a Shared Registration System (SRS). This encompasses the
    lifecycle of a domain name registration using domain registrars and
    protocols such as the Extensible Provisioning Protocol (EPP) and adherence
    to policies regarding the use and transparency domain name registrations
    through reporting, the Registration Data Access Protocol (RDAP), and other
    mechanisms.

    Unlike the "business as usual" test plans (e.g. The Pre-Delegation Test) the
    TLD string(s) that will be used will not be real (delegated or applied-for)
    TLDs but test TLDs that will be determined by ICANN. Test subjects will be
    required to configure their systems to support these TLDs prior to the start
    of the test run.

  Order: 8
  Name: DNS RSP Evaluation Test
  Description: |
    DNS RSPs provide primary or secondary authoritative DNS services. Therefore,
    this test plan only covers the DNS area.

    RSPs wishing to offer DNSSEC services in addition to authoritative DNS will
    also be evaluated using the DNSSEC RSP Evaluation Test.

    Unlike the "business as usual" test plans (e.g. The Pre-Delegation Test) the
    TLD string(s) that will be used will not be real (delegated or applied-for)
    TLDs but test TLDs that will be determined by ICANN. Test subjects will be
    required to configure their systems to support these TLDs prior to the start

  Name: DNSSEC RSP Evaluation Test
  Description: |
    DNSSEC RSPs provide signing of TLD zone files as a service. They do not
    provide primary or secondary authoritative DNS services.

    RSPs wishing to offer authoritative DNS services in addition to
    authoritative DNS will also be evaluated using the DNS RSP Evaluation Test.

    Unlike the "business as usual" test plans (e.g. The Pre-Delegation Test) the

SRSGatewayRSPTest:
  Order: 10
  Name: SRS Gateway RSP Evaluation Test
  Description: |
    SRS Gateway RSPs provide a proxy between a subset of Registrars and the
    Registry. It uses a local cache to speed up EPP query commands, but forwards
    all EPP transform commands to the primary registry system. TLD registries
    need to deploy a proxy setup in order to operate in certain markets
    worldwide.

    The [SRS Gateway test suite](#Test-Suite-StandardSRSGateway) requires access
    to a primary registry system that is logically independent of the SRS
    Gateway system, and details of the primary registry system are required as
    input parameters.

    RSPs wishing to offer SRS gateway services **MUST** identify such a primary
    registry system, which **MUST** be independent of the SRS gateway system,
    and **MAY** be operated by a third party.

    Unlike the "business as usual" test plans (e.g. The Pre-Delegation Test) the
    TLD string(s) that will be used will not be real (delegated or applied-for)
    TLDs but test TLDs that will be determined by ICANN. Test subjects will be
    required to configure their systems to support these TLDs prior to the start
    of the test run.
