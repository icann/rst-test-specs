idn.testLabelsForOTE:
  Description: |
    Test cases in the IDN test suite require a set of test labels which are used
    to compute domain names used in EPP `<create>` commands. These test labels
    are provided when IDN table objects are created through the API.

    In production, these objects will be created by ICANN org, but for OT&E,
    test subjects must create IDN table objects themselves, and must therefore
    provide test labels.

    Test subjects are free to submit any test labels they wish, but in order to
    properly simulate a production test, the same set of labels should be used.

    This resource is a zip file containing JSON files, each of which contains
    the test labels for the [Second-Level Reference
    LGR](https://www.icann.org/resources/pages/second-level-lgr-2015-06-21-en)
    identified by the script or language tag in the file name. The JSON files
    conform to the `idnTableRequest` object type from the [RST-API
    specification](https://icann.github.io/rst-api-spec/).

    For more information, see <https://github.com/icann/rst-idn-test-labels>.
