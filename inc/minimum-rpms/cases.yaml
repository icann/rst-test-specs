  Summary: Claims <check> command test
  Maturity: GAMMA
  Description: |
    This test is used to confirm the conformance of the EPP server's
    implementation of the Claims Check Form, as described in Section
    3.1.1 of RFC 8334.

    For this test, the applicant must configure their system using the test
    TMCH data files found in the following resources:

    * `tmch.testCert`
    * `tmch.testCRL`
    * `tmch.testDNL`
    * `tmch.testSMDRL`
    * `tmch.testSURL`

    The client will connect to the EPP server using the provided credentials
    and will then perform a series of `<check>` commands, using the Launch
    extension to specify a value of `claims` for the `type` attribute of the
    `<launch:check>` element and the `<launch:phase>` element. It will then
    confirm that the server returns an appropriate response:

    * a `<check>` response for a domain that is present on the DNL contains
      the correct `<launch:claimKey>` element;
    * a `<check>` response for a domain that is NOT present on the DNL
      does not contain a `<launch:claimKey>` element.
  Errors:
    - EPP_DNS_RESOLUTION_ERROR
    - EPP_SERVICE_PORT_UNREACHABLE
    - EPP_NO_SERVICE_PORTS_REACHABLE
    - EPP_TLS_CONNECTION_ERROR
    - EPP_XML_PARSE_ERROR
    - EPP_SCHEMA_VALIDATION_ERROR
    - EPP_LOGIN_ERROR
    - RPMS_MISSING_CLAIMS_KEY
    - RPMS_UNEXPECTED_CLAIMS_KEY
    - RPMS_INVALID_CLAIMS_KEY

    Sunrise domain/launch application <create> command test
  Maturity: GAMMA
  Description: |
    This test is used to confirm the conformance of the EPP server's
    implementation of the Sunrise Create Form, as described in Section
    3.3.1 of RFC 8334.

    For this test, the applicant must configure their system using the test
    TMCH data files found in the following resources:

    * `tmch.testCert`
    * `tmch.testCRL`
    * `tmch.testDNL`
    * `tmch.testSMDRL`
    * `tmch.testSURL`

    The client will connect to the EPP server and will submit `<create>`
    commands, using domain names and SMD files present in the TMCH test
    environment.

    If the server supports Start Date sunrises, the fully-qualified domain
    name will be constructed using a label from the SMD file and the
    `minimumRPMS.sunriseTLD` input parameter. If the domain is not already
    present in the registry, the Server **MUST** respond with a `1000` or `1001`
    result code, however, if the client receives a `2302` "object exists" result
    code, it will retry with a different domain name, until a `1000` or `1001`
    response is received.

    If the server supports End Date sunrises, the fully-qualified domain
    name will be constructed using a label from the SMD file and the
    `minimumRPMS.sunriseTLD` input parameter. The Server **MUST** respond with
    a `1000` or `1001` result code, and create a launch application.

    Once the `<create>` commands have been processed, the client will then
    perform `<info>` commands to confirm that the domains or launch applications
    have been created and that the submitted object properties have been
    correctly stored.

    The client will also confirm that the server rejects attempts to:

    1. create a domain using an invalid SMD;
    2. create a domain using a revoked SMD;
    3. create a domain using an SMD signed by a revoked certificate.
    4. create a domain using an SMD for a different domain.

    - EPP_NO_SERVICE_PORTS_REACHABLE

    - EPP_XML_PARSE_ERROR

  Summary: Trademark claims domain <create> command test
  Maturity: GAMMA
  Description: |
    This test is used to confirm the conformance of the EPP server's
    implementation of the Claims Create Form, as described in Section
    3.3.2 of RFC 8334.

    For this test, the applicant must configure their system using the test
    TMCH data files found in the following resources:

    * `tmch.testCert`
    * `tmch.testCRL`
    * `tmch.testDNL`
    * `tmch.testSMDRL`
    * `tmch.testSURL`

    The client will connect to the EPP server and will submit `<create>`
    commands, using domain names present in the TMCH test environment.

    The domain name will be constructed using a label from the DNL, and the
    `minimumRPMS.claimsTLD` input parameter. The client will perform a
    Trademark Claims `<check>` command beforehand to obtain the claim key, and
    will then synthesise a trademark claims acknowledgement. The server
    **MUST** respond with a `1000` or `1001` response.

    Once the `<create>` commands have been processed, the client will then
    perform `<info>` commands to confirm that the domains have been created and
    that the submitted object properties have been correctly stored.

    The client will also confirm that the server rejects attempts to:

    1. create a domain using an invalid claim key;
    2. create a domain using an expired claim key;
    3. create a domain using an acceptance datetime more than 12 months in the
      past.
