dnssecOps01-ZSKRollover:
  Summary: ZSK rollover
  Description: |
    This test case verifies the RSP's ability to perform a ZSK rollover (as
    described in [Section 4.1.1 of
    RFC 6781](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6781#section-4.1.1) for
    a zone.

    If the value of the `dnssecOps.csk` input parameter is `true`, then this
    test will be skipped.

    The system will monitor the SOA record in the domain name specified in the
    `dnssec.zskRolloverZone` input parameter. The domain may be present
    anywhere in the DNS hierarchy (that is, it does not need to be a TLD), but
    **MUST** have a secure chain of trust up to the root zone, so that it can
    be validated using the root zone trust anchor.

    During the test period (currently defined as 24 hours) the operator
    **MUST** successfully carry out a ZSK rollover for the domain, where the
    Zone Signing Key is replaced, without disrupting the chain of trust.

    To simplify testing, applicants may wish to provision domain that is
    configured with short TTLs and a short ZSK lifetime, so that a ZSK
    rollover is guaranteed to occur within the 24 test period.
  Input-Parameters:
    - dnssecOps.csk
    - dnssecOps.zskRolloverZone

dnssecOps02-KSKRollover:
  Summary: KSK rollover
  Description: |
    This test case verifies the RSP's ability to perform a CSK/KSK rollover
    (as described in [Sections 4.1.2 and 4.13 of
    RFC 6781](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6781#section-4.1.2) for
    a zone.

    The system will monitor the SOA record in the domain name specified in the
    `dnssec.kskRolloverZone` input parameter. The domain may be present
    anywhere in the DNS hierarchy (that is, it does not need to be a TLD), but
    **MUST** have a secure chain of trust up to the root zone, so that it can
    be validated using the root zone trust anchor.

    During the test period (currently defined as 24 hours) the operator
    **MUST** successfully carry out a KSK rollover for the domain, where the
    Key Signing Key is replaced, and the DS record in the parent zone is
    updated, without disrupting the chain of trust.
  Input-Parameters:
    - dnssecOps.kskRolloverZone
  Dependencies:
dnssecOps03-AlgorithmRollover:
  Summary: algorithm rollover
  Description: |
    This test case verifies the RSP's ability to perform an algorithm rollover
    (as described in [Section 4.1.4 of
    RFC 6781](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6781#section-4.1.2) for
    a zone.

    The system will monitor the SOA record in the domain name specified in the
    `dnssec.algorithmRolloverZone` input parameter. The domain may be present
    anywhere in the DNS hierarchy (that is, it does not need to be a TLD), but
    **MUST** have a secure chain of trust up to the root zone, so that it can
    be validated using the root zone trust anchor.

    During the test period (currently defined as 72 hours) the operator
    **MUST** successfully carry out an algorithm rollover for the domain
    (including an update to the DS record in the parent zone), where the
    algorithm used to secure the domain is changed, without disrupting the
    chain of trust.

    Note that the specific algorithms being rolled to and from are not
    significant (although they **MUST** be present in the IANA registry); it
    is not required that the new algorithm be more "secure" than the original
    algorithm; only that they are different. So a rollover from algorithm 13
    (`ECDSAP256SHA256`) to algorithm 8 (`RSASHA256`) will be accepted as well
    as a rollover from `RSASHA256` to `ECDSAP256SHA256`.
  Input-Parameters:
    - dnssecOps.algorithmRolloverZone
