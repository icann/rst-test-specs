  Summary: IDNA2008 compliance check
  Maturity: GAMMA
  Description: |
    In addition to the other tests case in this suite, which come from
    Zonemaster, this test case exists to confirm that all DNS host names which
    appear in resource records at the TLD apex conform to the IDNA2008
    specifications, described in [RFC
    5890](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc5890.html).

    The names that appear in the `MNAME` and `RNAME` fields of TLD `SOA`
    records, and in the apex `NS` records, **MUST** be comprised solely of (a)
    NR-LDH labels (see Section [2.3.2.2 of RFC
    5890](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc5890.html#section-2.3.2.2)) or (b)
    IDN labels that conform to the requirements of IDNA2008.
  Errors:
    - DNS_IDNA2008_QUERY_FAILED
    - DNS_IDNA2008_INVALID_MNAME
    - DNS_IDNA2008_INVALID_RNAME
    - DNS_IDNA2008_INVALID_NS_NSDNAME

  Implemented: false
  Summary: Nameserver consistency check
  Maturity: BETA
  Description: |
    In addition to the other tests case in this suite, which come from
    Zonemaster, this test case verifies that all the nameservers (both logical
    and physical) specified in the `dns.nameservers` input parameter provide
    consistent responses.

    The test system will perform DNS queries from probe nodes in multiple
    locations around the world so that multiple physical nodes within an
    anycasted logical nameserver are tested.

    For each TLD in the test, the following queries will be sent, over UDP, TCP,
    and any additional transports that are supported (based on the
    `supportsDoT`, `supportsDoH` and `supportsDoQ` properties for the nameserver
    in question) to each IPv4 and IPv6 address for each nameserver:

    * apex `SOA` query;
    * apex `NS` query;
    * apex `DNSKEY` query;
    * apex `NSEC3PARAM` query;
    * apex `TXT` query;
    * `A` and `AAAA` queries for in-bailiwick nameservers, if any;
    * `nic.tld` `NS` query;
    * `nic.tld` `DS` query.

    The EDNS(0) `do` bit, `NSID` option, and `ZONEVERSION` options will be set
    on all queries. The reported `NSID` and `ZONEVERSION` values in the response
    (if any) will be included in logs for debugging purposes.

    For DoT, DoH and DoQ, no certificate validation will be performed.

    The test case will fail if:

    1. one or more queries timeout (within 1000ms for UDP and 3000ms for
       any other protocol), or
    2. The RCODE header field, or answer, authority or additional sections of
       the response differs, after normalization, from those of any previously
       received response, with the sole exception of the `serial` field of `SOA`
       records.

  Errors:
    - DNS_CONSISTENCY_QUERY_FAILED
    - DNS_INCONSISTENT_RESPONSES
