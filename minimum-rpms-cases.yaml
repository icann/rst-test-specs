    Summary: |
      Sunrise domain/launch application <create> command test
    Description: |
      This test is used to confirm the conformance of the EPP server's
      implementation of the Sunrise Create Form, as described in Section
      3.3.1 of RFC 8334.

      For this test, it is assumed that the EPP server has been configured to
      use data (specifically the Domain Name Label List, as described in Section
      5.3.3.1 of RFC 9361) from the TMCH test environment.

      The client will connect to the EPP server and will submit `<create>`
      commands, using domain names and SMD files present in the TMCH test
      environment.

      If the server supports Start Date sunrises, the fully-qualified domain
      name will be constructed using a label from the SMD file and the
      `minimumRPMS.sunriseTLD` input parameter. The Server **MUST** respond with
      a 1000 or 1001 result code, however, if the client receives a 2302 "object
      exists" result code, it will retry with a different domain name.

      The client will also attempt to create a domain using an invalid SMD,
      which the server **MUST** reject.

      If the server supports End Date sunrises, the fully-qualified domain
      name will be constructed using a label from the SMD file and the
      `minimumRPMS.sunriseTLD` input parameter. The Server **MUST** respond with
      a 1000 or 1001 result code.

      The client will also attempt to create a domain using an invalid SMD,
      which the server **MUST** reject.

      **TODO: test create with revoked certificate**
      **TODO: test create with revoked SMD**

      If the server supports both modes, then both of the above tests will be
      performed.

      **TODO: merge info case below**

    Summary: Sunrise launch application <info> command test
    Description: |
      In this test, the client will perform `<info>` commands on the objects
      created in `minimumRPMs-01` and will confirm that they have successfully
      been created in the repository and have the correct object properties.

      * a start-date sunrise `<create>` command **MUST** result in the creation
        of a domain object;
      * an end-date sunrise `<create>` command **MUST** result in the creation
        of a launch application.

    Summary: Claims <check> command test
    Description: |
      This test is used to confirm the conformance of the EPP server's
      implementation of the Claims Check Form, as described in Section
      3.1.1 of RFC 8334.

      For this test, it is assumed that the EPP server has been configured to
      use data (specifically the Domain Name Label List, as described in Section
      5.3.3.1 of RFC 9361) from the TMCH test environment.

      The client will connect to the EPP server using the provided credentials
      and will then perform a series of `<check>` commands, using the Launch
      extension to specify a value of `claims` for the `type` attribute of the
      `<launch:check>` element and the `<launch:phase>` element. It will then
      confirm that the server returns an appropriate
      response:

      * a `<check>` response for a domain that is present on the DNL contains
        the correct `<launch:claimKey>` element;
      * a `<check>` response for a domain that is NOT present on the DNL
        does not contain a `<launch:claimKey>` element.

    Summary: Trademark claims domain <create> command test
    Description: |
      This test is used to confirm the conformance of the EPP server's
      implementation of the Claims Create Form, as described in Section
      3.3.2 of RFC 8334.

      For this test, it is assumed that the EPP server has been configured to
      use data (specifically the Domain Name Label List, as described in Section
      5.3.3.1 of RFC 9361) from the TMCH test environment.

      The client will connect to the EPP server and will submit `<create>`
      commands, using domain names present in the TMCH test environment.

      The domain name will be constructed using a label from the DNL, and the
      `minimumRPMS.claimsTLD` input parameter. The client will perform a
      Trademark Claims `<check>` command beforehand to obtain the claim key, and
      will then synthesise a trademark claims acknowledgement. The server
      **MUST** respond with a 1000 or 10001 response.

      The client will also perform `<create>` command using an invalid
      claims acknowledgements **TODO: (invalid claim key, expiry date, see RFC
      9361)**. The server **MUST** respond with a 2xxx error.

      **TODO: do info afterwards**
