   "Preamble" : "This file describes each test [plan](#test-plans), [suite](#test-suites) and\n[case](#test-cases) in the RST system, as well as the\n[input parameters](#input-parameters) required for each, relevant\n[resources](#resources), any inter-case dependencies, and the\n[errors](#errors) that might occur during testing.\n\nThe key words \"MUST\", \"MUST NOT\", \"REQUIRED\", \"SHALL\", \"SHALL NOT\", \"SHOULD\",\n\"SHOULD NOT\", \"RECOMMENDED\", \"NOT RECOMMENDED\", \"MAY\", and \"OPTIONAL\" in this\ndocument are to be interpreted as described in [RFC\n2119](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc2119.html) when, and only when, they\nappear in all capitals, as shown here.\n\n# 2.1. Test plans\n\nAn individual *Test Plan* addresses a particular scenario (for example, RSP\nevaluation or Pre-Delegation Testing). Each plan consists of one or more *test\nsuites*, which in turn include one or more *test cases*.\n\n## 2.1.1. Test plan types\n\nThere are two types of test plan described in this document:\n\n* **Business as usual** plans, which are used as part of the lifecycle of a\ngTLD (Pre-Delegion Test, RSP/DNS RSP change Test, IDN Test, SRS Gateway\nTest)\n* **RSP evaluation** plans, which are used as part of the RSP evaluation\nprogram.\n\n# 2.2. Test suites\n\nA *Test Suite* is a collection of *test cases* with a common theme or subject\nmatter, for example, Authoritative DNS or Registry Data Escrow.\n\n# 2.3. Test cases\n\nA *Test Case* describes a process for determining the conformance or\nacceptability of a certain element of the system.\n\nA test case consists of a *test procedure* which accepts zero or more **input\nparameters**, and generates one or more **test results**.\n\n## 2.3.1. Input parameters\n\nAll test cases require some information about the subject of the test, for\nexample, service hostnames, credentials, and functional parameters. These\n*input parameters* may be shared across multiple test cases.\n\n## 2.3.2. Test environments\n\nEach test plan indicates whether the test is to be carried out in the\nproduction environment, or whether a test, staging or OT&E environment may be\nused. In general, test plans which are designed for \"business as usual\" use\nduring the lifecycle of a TLD **MUST** be carried out in the production\nregistry infrastructure, while RSP evaluation tests **MAY** be carried out in\ntest, staging or OT&E environments.\n\n## 2.3.3. Test results\n\nTest cases will generate one or more *test results*. Test results indicate the\noutcome of the test and other relevant information.\n\n## 2.3.4. General pass/fail criteria\n\nIn general, for a test to pass, **all** the test cases specified in the test\nsuite(s) for the test plan **MUST** pass: if *any* fail, then the test as a\nwhole will fail.\n\nA test case will fail if it produces one or more [errors](#errors) with the\n`ERROR` or `CRITICAL` severities.\n\n## 2.3.5. Error severity levels\n\nThe supported severity levels are a subset of the values defined in RFC 5424.\n\n2. `WARNING` - an issue which does not prevent the test from *passing*, but\n which may benefit from further investigation.\n1. `ERROR` - an issue which prevents the test case from *passing*, but does not\n prevent the test case from *continuing*. A test case may produce multiple\n `ERROR` results.\n2. `CRITICAL` - an issue which prevents the test case from continuing any\n further. A test case will only produce a single `CRITICAL` result and it\n will always be the last result in the log.\n\n## 2.3.6. Common errors\n\nFor each test case, various errors and critical errors are defined which will\nbe used to signal why that the case might have failed.\n\nIn addition to these, there are a number of errors which any test case may\nproduce, which are:\n\n* [TBA]\n\n# 2.4. Test procedures\n\nWhere possible, test cases will reuse existing connections and any objects\ncreated as part of previous test cases, to reduce the resources required to\nperform service testing. However, it is anticipated that registry services will\nsee a moderate volume of connections from test systems, and a moderate number of\nobjects may be created as part of the test. The level of resource consumption is\nanticipated to be significantly lower than that experienced by a live production\nsystem, so in \"business as usual\" scenarios, where production systems are being\ntested, no impact to those systems is expected.\n\nWhere a test is being carried out using test, staging or OT&E environments, then\nthose systems should be provisioned with sufficient capacity to allow testing to\nbe carried out without interruption. Any existing OT&E environment supporting\nregistrar integration testing and onboarding is likely to be sufficiently robust\nto support Registry System Testing with no further additional capacity\nrequirements.\n\n# 2.5.
