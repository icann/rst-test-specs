This site hosts the specifications for ICANN's [Registry System Testing
(RST)](https://icann.org/resources/registry-system-testing-v2.0) v2.0 service.

* **[rst-test-specs.html](rst-test-specs.html)
  is the human-readable version of the RST test specification.**

* [rst-test-specs.yaml](rst-test-specs.yaml)
  is the machine-readable version, intended to be consumed by internal ICANN
  clients.

* [rst-test-specs.json](rst-test-specs.json)
  is the above file in JSON. Note that the conversion from YAML causes keys in
  dictionaries to be reordered.

* [rst.json](rst.json) is the Zonemaster
  [profile](https://github.com/zonemaster/zonemaster/blob/master/docs/public/configuration/profiles.md)
  used by the DNS and DNSSEC test suites.
