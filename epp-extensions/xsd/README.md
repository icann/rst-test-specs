# EPP Extension XSD Files

This directory contains XML schema files for the EPP extensions that are listed
in the EPP Extension Registry, where the schema is embedded in the specification
and not available at a separate URL. Dependencies (other schemas referenced in
<import> elements) are also present in this directory.

Where possible, schemas have been extracted verbatim, but in some cases (for
example, where schemas in a paginated document are split across pages) they have
been edited to ensure they are well-formed XML instances.
