  Summary: Label validation test
  Maturity: BETA
  Description: |
    This test confirms that the EPP server correctly accepts or rejects domain
    `<create>` commands for valid and invalid IDN labels, respectively.

    If there are no IDN tables supported under any of the TLDs associated with
    the test, then this test will be skipped.

    For each supported IDN table, the test client will perform a series of
    `<create>` commands using a pre-defined catalogue of test labels. If
    required, the client will create any contact object(s) needed.

    The server **MUST** reject all `<create>` commands for invalid labels and
    **MUST** accept all `<create>` commands for valid labels.

  Summary: Level 1 variant handling test
  Maturity: BETA
  Description: |
    This test confirms the EPP server's conformance with the Level 1 variant
    support (no support for variant activation, all variants are blocked).

    If there are no IDN tables for which Level 1 support is claimed, this
    test will be skipped.

    For each supported IDN table, the test client will perform a series of
    `<create>` commands using a pre-defined catalogue of test labels. If
    required, the client will create any contact object(s) needed.

    The client will then submit `<create>` commands for one or more labels
    that are variants of the names created in the first step. The server
    **MUST** reject these commands.

  Summary: Level 2 variant handling test
  Maturity: BETA
  Description: |
    This test confirms the EPP server's conformance with the Level 2 variant
    support (variants are supported within the same TLD).

    If there are no IDN tables for which Level 2 support is claimed, this
    test will be skipped.

    For each supported IDN table, the test client will perform a series of
    `<create>` commands using a pre-defined catalogue of test labels. If
    required, the client will create any contact object(s) needed.

    The client will then submit `<create>` commands for one or more labels
    that are variants of the names created in the first step. Some of these
    commands will be made using the same registrar account as the first step,
    while some will be made using alternate credentials. If the value of the
    `general.minimalPublicDataSet` input parameter is `false`, then some
    commands will also use a different registrant contact.

    The server **MUST** reject `<create>` commands where the (a) registrar is
    different from that of the primary label or (b) the registrant (if
    applicable) is different.

  Summary: Level 3 variant handling test
  Maturity: BETA
  Description: |
    This test confirms the EPP server's conformance with the Level 3 variant
    support (variants are supported within variant TLD(s)).

    If there are no IDN tables for which Level 3 support is claimed, this
    test will be skipped.

    For each supported IDN table, the test client will perform a series of
    `<create>` commands using a pre-defined catalogue of test labels. If
    required, the client will create any contact object(s) needed.

    The client will then submit `<create>` commands for one or more labels
    that are variants (at both second- and top-level) of the names created in
    the first step. Some of these commands will be made using the same
    registrar account as the first step, while some will be made using
    alternate credentials. If the value of the `general.minimalPublicDataSet`
    input parameter is `false`, then some commands will also use a different
    registrant contact.

    The server **MUST** reject `<create>` commands where the (a) registrar is
    different from that of the primary label or (b) the registrant (if
    applicable) is different.
